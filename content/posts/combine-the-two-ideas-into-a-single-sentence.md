Trends in computing: What new ways will information and communication technologies change the way we use and understand our world?
Technology has always had a huge impact on our lives. The development of information and communication technologies has led to a whole new level of interactivity and understanding between people and the world around them. Some of the most significant changes that will occur in this area are as follows:
