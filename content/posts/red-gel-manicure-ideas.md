Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.

The final word: What is the most important thing you can learn from your experiences with developing and implementing big ideas?
Big ideas are a staple in business and life, but they can be difficult to implement. Here are three tips for developing big ideas:
1. Be prepared to fail. The most important thing you can learn from your experiences with big ideas is that it’s not always easy or straightforward to reach your goals. Don’t be discouraged – look for ways to overcome any obstacles and reach your destination.

2. Take the time to analyze your success rates. It can be helpful to track how often you achieve your goals with big ideas compared to other projects you’ve worked on in the past. This will give you a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t when it comes time to put big ideas into practice.

3. Be persistent.
