The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.

How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.

How to Choose the Right Home Improvement Project
Choosing the right home improvement project can be daunting, but with a little creativity and some helpful tips, it's easy to get started on your dreams. Here are a few tips to help you choose the right project:
1. Consider your budget: Even if you have an unlimited budget, it's important to take into account what you can spend and what you need. If you're limited in funds, consider using a lower-cost option rather than investing in an expensive home improvement project.

2. Work with a professional: When choosing a home improvement project, work with someone who has experience and knowledge of the industry. This will save time and money on the end result.

3. Take into account your space: Not every room needs new flooring or curtains; instead, focus on specific areas that need attention.
