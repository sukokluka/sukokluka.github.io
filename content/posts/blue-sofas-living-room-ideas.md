Pre-existing Conditions: What are some potential solutions to this problem?
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people looking for ways to help those who have pre-existing conditions. A variety of solutions have been proposed, with the most popular being increasing access to health insurance and creating new government programs that would help those with pre-existing conditions.

Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?
