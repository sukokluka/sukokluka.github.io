4) Transform transportation infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure is important for both people and businesses. It includes roads, bridges, airports, and other areas that allow people to move around and businesses to run their operations. But as the world moves increasingly towards electric vehicles and other forms of transportation that don't use gasoline or oil, the need for transportation infrastructure will only become more important. 
One way to improve the transportation infrastructure is to create more efficient ways to generate energy. Another way to improve it is to consider how people can be better connected with one another while they are on their way to or from work or school. 

There are a number of ideas that could be put into place in order to improve transportation infrastructure.

The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.
