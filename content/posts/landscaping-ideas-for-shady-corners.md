What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas: 
1. Start with one. This may seem like a ridiculously simple suggestion, but if you don’t have any big ideas to start with, you won’t be able to come up with anything great. After all, success isn’t about having a lot of small accomplishments; it’s about achieving great things starting small. 
2. Take things one step at a time.
