Creative Ideas: When working with clients, always have an idea of what you want to achieve. This will help you to better understand the client's needs and desires. Additionally, it can give you a starting point for your proposals and ideas. If you're not sure what the client wants, ask them! This will help to ensure that your proposal is tailored specifically to their needs and wishes.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of change that can create new opportunities and businesses. They are often inspired by a specific problem or situation and can be wide-ranging, ambitious, and futuristic. By definition, big ideas are something new and different - they could be anything from developing a new product to creating a new way of doing business. However, no matter what their size or location, any big idea is capable of blurring the lines between reality and imagination.
