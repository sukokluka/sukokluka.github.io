What are some new ideas?
There are a lot of new ideas out there these days. Here are some of the most popular: 
1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

Ideas for the future of technology are constantly being created, but it is difficult to come up with a definite plan. One thing that seems to be on the horizon is the potential for artificial intelligence to take over many tasks that humans would currently use. This could have a large impact on society, as well as the economy. Another trend that has been growing in recent years is the usage of 3D printing technology. This allows users to create objects without having to use a traditional manufacturing process.
