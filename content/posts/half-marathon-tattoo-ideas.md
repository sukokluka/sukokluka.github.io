The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.

The finished product: What does it look like and how does it work?
If you're like most people, you probably have a basic understanding of how a watch works and what it looks like. But if you're looking for tips on how to build your own watch, there's still a lot you don't know.  So, in this article, we'll take a look at how to make a simple wristwatch using only materials you likely have at home. 
So first off, all you need is some leather or plastic wrap and some screws. You'll also need an electric drill and some wood screws. Next, take the leather or plastic wrap and cut it into 1" pieces.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative ideas that can change the way we live and work. From developing new transportation systems to improving food quality, there are many ways to put big ideas into practice.
One way to get started onbig ideas is by thinking about what others have done before you. When you come up with a great idea, don’t just credit yourself – give your idea a name and make it a point to share it with others. This way, you can get feedback and help others build on your idea.

Once you’ve got some good big ideas under your belt, it’s time for the hard part: coming up with ways to make them a reality.
