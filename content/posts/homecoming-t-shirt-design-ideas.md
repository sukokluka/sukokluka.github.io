How to do them: How to start a DIY project
Doing a project yourself can be fun, but it can also be a lot of work. There are a few things you need to keep in mind before starting any project: tools, supplies, and techniques. Here are five tips for starting your own DIY projects: 
- Get organized: Start by organizing your materials and tools. This will make it easier to take apart the project later on. 
- Preheat your oven: prepping your oven will help you get started faster and avoid any problems down the road. 
- Be patient: Don’t rush anything. Take your time and make sure everything you need is at hand before beginning the project. 
- Use a level: Use a level when checking against the measurements provided or when making slight changes to the design.

Inventions can be small, like a new way to open a jar, or big, like a new type of engine. They can be simple, like a new way to tie a shoe, or complex, like a new computer system.
