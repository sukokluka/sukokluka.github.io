Developing Your Idea: Once you have an idea, how do you develop it into a functional product?
If you have an invention idea, you may be wondering how to develop it into a functional product. The first step is to do some research and make sure your idea is unique. You can search online patent databases or contact a patent attorney to help you with this process.
Once you have determined that your idea is new and novel, the next step is to start developing it. This may involve creating a prototype or working with a manufacturer to produce a working model of your invention. The key is to keep moving forward and not get bogged down in the details.

With perseverance and a little luck, you can turn your invention idea into a reality. Just remember to take things one step at a time and always consult with experts when necessary.
