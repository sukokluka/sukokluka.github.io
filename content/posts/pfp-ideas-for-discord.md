What is a blog and why should you have one?
Blogging is a great way to share your thoughts, ideas and experiences with the world. It can also be used as a platform to connect with people from around the internet. Whether you're just starting out or have been blogging for awhile, there are some key things to keep in mind when starting a blog. Here are six reasons why you should start a blog: 1) You can use your blog as an outlet for your creative juices to flow; 2) You can use your blog as an opportunity to network with other bloggers and potential clients; 3) You can share your own content (blogs, articles, videos etc.) and generate traffic from Google Adsense; 4) You could create a blog and offer free or paid services such as website design, ad management or email marketing; 5) Blogging could help you build brand awareness - if it's well-done and targeted correctly!
