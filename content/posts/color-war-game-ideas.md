How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.

Types of ideas: What should be in a good idea?
Ideas are a vital ingredient in any business or product. They can be used to originate new concepts, improve on an existing product, or create a new market. However, how well ideas are executed can greatly affect their success. Here are a few tips on how to make your ideas executable:
1. Be specific: The first step in Executing an Idea is to be specific about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you to focus and ensure that your idea is communicated effectively.

2. Be Efficient: Once you have identified what you want your idea to achieve, it is important to focus on how best to achieve it within the confines of your time and resources. This means being efficient in both the development of your idea and the execution of it.
