2. Improved Delight at Work – While some businesses may find it difficult to come up with creative ideas, creative thinking often leads to increased delight and satisfaction with work. This is due in part to the fact that creativity opens up new possibilities and helps businesses explore the potential of their products or services in a more interesting way than if they were just following pre-determined paths.
