Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better. This is what makes innovation so important – it allows companies to constantly improve their products and services while also taking advantage of new opportunities.
But the main difference between innovation and other types of innovation is that innovation is not always about money. In fact, some people argue that innovation should only be considered when it creates value for society as a whole – otherwise, it’s just called “innovation” by those in the business world. However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t always a cost associated with innovative work – in fact, there often is.

The Benefits of New Ideas: What do they offer?
The benefits of new ideas are vast and range from more efficient ways to do things to new and innovative products that can change the way people live. Here are a few examples: 
1. New ideas can help you save time and money. If you can think of a way to make your work or home easier, you may be able to save time and money on tasks that you previously would have had to spend hours completing. 
2. New ideas can improve your creativity. When you come up with new ideas, it can be difficult not to come up with something that is both good and useful. By taking some time for yourself to come up with new ideas, you will be more likely to find something onerous or simply useless as well as something valuable that you could implement into your life immediately. 
3. New ideas can make life easier.

How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.
