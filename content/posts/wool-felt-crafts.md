Creativity is an unpredictable process that often occurs during the creative process. It can be considered a type of improvisation, which is where ideas and thoughts come together without pre-determined plans or expectations. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: ideation, creation, and Implementation. Ideation is when something new and unheard of comes to mind, while creation is when it is put into a realistic form through creativity and collaboration. Implementation is when the ideas are put into practice and turned into a reality.
