What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.

Creativity in the arts: Some key aspects to consider.
Creativity in the arts goes beyond the creation of artworks or sculptures. It can also be found in the use of ideas and concepts, as well as working with others to create something beautiful. Whether it’s a hobby or a profession, creativity is important to have at any stage of life. Here are some key aspects to consider when trying to achieve creativity: 
1) Be open-minded: One of the most important things to remember when trying to be creative is that no two things are ever alike. As such, you must be willing to try new things and explore different fields of thought. However, don’t forget that creativity comes from within – so if you can remain patient and allow your thoughts and ideas to grow, you will eventually find an avocado on the grocery store shelf that matches your design inspiration!
