How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.

Tools: How should you use the tools you have?
If you have a few tools that you like to use, it's important to know how to use them in order to get the most out of them. Here are four easy ways to use your tools the right way:
1) Make a toolset: When you have a few tools, it's better to make a toolset rather than purchase individual tools. This will save you time and money in the long run. A good starting point is an electronic toolkit, such as this one from Amazon. You can find other options here.

2) Use common sense: It's important not only to be able to use your tools but also be aware of what they do. If something doesn't work or doesn't seem right, try turning it around and using another tool instead.
