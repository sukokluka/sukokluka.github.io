The Importance of Ideas: How important are ideas?
Ideas are important, no matter what you do. Ideas can help you solve problems and come up with new ideas. They can also help you get ahead in your career or life.
However, it's important to note that not everything comes from ideas. Sometimes, something has to be done before an idea can be a reality. This is where hard work comes in. You have to be dedicate and commit to working on the idea for as long as it takes - even if it means putting in the extra hours and effort.

Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.
