The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!

Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.
