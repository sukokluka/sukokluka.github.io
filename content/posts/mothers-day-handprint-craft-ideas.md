The future of healthcare: How will healthcare change in the 2020s?
In 2020, healthcare will be a trillion dollar industry. It is expected that the cost of healthcare will continue to rise as more and more people are diagnosed with chronic diseases and require long-term care. There are many ideas for how healthcare will change in the next decade, but one idea that is gaining traction is the idea of using blockchain technology to streamline the process of Healthcare. Blockchain technology can help to reduce the cost of healthcare by making it easier for patients and doctors to track interactions between them and make decisions faster. This could improve communication and coordination between providers and patients, which could lead to better patient outcomes. The potential benefits of using blockchain technology in healthcare are vast, and it is likely that it will become an increasingly important part of the industry in the coming years.
