Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, American scientist Samuel Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail developed the first practical telephone. This invention gave people the ability to communicate with one another without leaving their homes or using traveling telegraphs.

The telephone is still an important part of our lives today.
