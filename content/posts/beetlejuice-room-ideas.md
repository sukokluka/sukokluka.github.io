Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem.

While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.
