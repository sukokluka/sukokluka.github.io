2. Electrification – This could be everything from finding ways to run energy inefficient appliances without them being turned on all the time to installing solar panels and wind turbines in order to generate power for the grid.

What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups.
