The Importance of Innovation in the Future: What will be the effects of continued innovation?
Innovation is an important factor in the future as it will play a major role in helping to move forward. There are many different types of innovation, which can be broken down into two main categories: technological and business-related. Technology-related innovations can improve the efficiency of industries or make new products or services more accessible. Business-related innovations can help companies to survive and grow in today’s economy. There are many different types of innovation, but each one has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. If left unchecked, innovation could have negative effects on society as a whole. To ensure that the effects of continued innovation are positive, it is important for businesses and government to work together to create policies that support innovation.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.
