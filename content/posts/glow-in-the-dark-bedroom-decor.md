History of innovation: How has it been used and abused in the past?
The history of innovation is filled with examples of it being used and abused. In the past, innovation has been used to improve efficiency, increase production, decrease costs, and create new products. However, these same advantages can also be abused if not Properly managed.

Innovation can be abused when it is used for unoriginal or unwanted purposes. For example, in the early 1900srialist countries like Russia used innovation to produce innovative Catherine the Great cars while developing other technologies behind the scenes which led to their rise to power. By doing this, they were able to stay afloat during a time where other countries were struggling.
