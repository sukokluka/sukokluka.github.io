What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:

2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.

4) making school harder than necessary.
