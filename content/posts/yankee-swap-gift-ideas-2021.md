The history of innovation
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. The first instance of innovation was when early man used a sharpened rock to make a spear. This allowed him to kill animals for food and protect himself from predators. Since then, there have been many other instances of innovation.
The wheel is another example of innovation. It was invented by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. The wheel made it possible to transport goods and people over long distances. It also helped to speed up production in factories and workshops.

The printing press is another important invention that has had a major impact on the world. It was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it made it possible to mass-produce books and other printed materials. This had a huge impact on education and knowledge sharing.
