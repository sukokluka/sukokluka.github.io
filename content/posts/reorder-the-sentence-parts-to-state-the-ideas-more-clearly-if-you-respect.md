The Differences between Creative Art and Reality Art: There are a few different types of creative art, but they all have one common goal â€“ to inspire.
Creative art is all about inspiring people to think differently. Reality art, on the other hand, is all about reality. They may have different goals, but they both aim to promote an accurate representation of the world around them. Here are some key differences between creative and reality art: 
1) Creative artists often use their own imagination to create pieces that are unique and inspiring. Reality artists often rely on real-world objects or events to create their work. 
2) Creative artists often use more color and light than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on shadows and reflections for their work. 
3) Creative artists often use more movement than reality artists. Reality artists often rely on stills and images to create their pieces.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are always a good thing, especially when they can help improve someone's day-to-day life. Here are some of the best ideas around: 
1. Make a list of what you need in order to start painting or sculpting. This will give you a starting point for creating something that you're passionate about and can work on for hours. 
2. Draw inspiration from other cultures and their art styles. This can help you to create pieces that are unique and interesting. 
3. Take a walk outside and take in the atmosphere. This can provide you with many different ideas for art projects that you may not have considered before. 
4. Use technology to your advantage! If you have an Instagram or Facebook account, start postulating creative ways to use it in your artwork instead of just letting it be an eyesore.
