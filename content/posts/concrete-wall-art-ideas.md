What are the different ways to come up with ideas?
Let's face it, come up with ideas can be a challenge. But there are different ways to approach coming up with them. Here are three ways: 
1. Brainstorm with others: When you're stuck, brainstorm with other people to get their help. They might have a better idea than you do, and they might be more willing to share what they know.

2. Take a walk: Take a walk around your neighborhood or city to get new ideas for businesses or products. This can also lead you to places where you haven't thought of before.

3. Find an online course: If all else fails, take an online course on creativity in business or product design. This can help you learn how to come up with ideas from scratch and see how different techniques work in the real world.
