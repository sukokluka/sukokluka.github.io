Big ideas are those that could have a significant impact on the world. They can be things that people have never thought of, or ideas that are relatively new and unexplored. Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.

patenting inventions: What is the process of getting an invention patent?
There is the process of patenting inventions, which can be a long and difficult process. Patent applications must be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After an application is filed, the USPTO will review it and may ask for changes or modifications. If approved, the application will then be sent to a full-blown prosecution process. This can take several months or even years. Once the full-blown prosecution process is complete, an invention may be registered with the USPTO as a trademark, trade name, or other intellectual property.
