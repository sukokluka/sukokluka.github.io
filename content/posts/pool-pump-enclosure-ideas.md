The Top 5 Diy Ideas for House Cleaning
1. Make a simple cleaning routine: daily sweeping, dusting, mopping, and vacuuming will help keep your home clean and free of dirt and dust mites.
2. Use an all-natural cleaner: certain ingredients can help remove dirt and other stains from surfaces without harsh chemicals.
3. Add a touch of Grace: think about ways to add personality to your home with furniture or decor that is fresh and new.
4. Keep your windows clear: use a screen protector or window cleaner to keep the view looking great while keeping particles out of the glass panes.
5. Add some whimsy: consider adding wacky little accessories to your home like jester hats or incenses to give it a whimsical feel.
