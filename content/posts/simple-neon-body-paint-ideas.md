2) Be open-minded and willing to consider different perspectives. If you're always open to hearing other people's opinions and considering different points of view, you'll be more likely to have your own original thoughts on a subject.

3) Take time to daydream and let your mind wander. Sometimes the best way to come up with big ideas is simply to relax and let your mind wander.
