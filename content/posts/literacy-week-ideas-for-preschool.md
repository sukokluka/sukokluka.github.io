Innovation is important for several reasons. First, without innovation businesses would become stagnant and eventually fail. To stay competitive, businesses must be constantly moving forward and improving upon their current offerings. Additionally, innovation can lead to new and improved products and services that customers will demand. Finally, innovation can help businesses to cut costs and improve efficiency.
