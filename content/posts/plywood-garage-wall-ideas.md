The future of creative art: What changes are likely to occur in the future and why?
Creative art has been around for centuries and is a key part of many cultures. However, with the advent of new technologies and an ever-growing population, the future of creative art is uncertain.

Others predict that creativity will continue to thrive and that it will be used in more creative ways. There are many potential reasons why this may happen, but one thing is for sure: the future of creative art is still largely unknown.

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?

Brainstorming Tips: How do you best use brainstorming to come up with new ideas?
brainstorming is an effective tool for coming up with new ideas. However, there are a few things you can do to make the process more efficient and effective. First, try to group your ideas together so that they are easier to understand. Additionally, use active listening techniques to help you hear and understand what your potential clients or customers are saying. Finally, be sure to keep track of what you come up with during brainstorming so that you can later refer back to it and develop new ideas based on what you heard.
