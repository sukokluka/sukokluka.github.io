Introduce the topic of ideas.
There are a lot of ideas out there. Some are good, and some are bad. But how do you know which ones are worth your time? In this article, we'll introduce the topic of ideas and explore some ways to tell if an idea is worth your time.
First, let's define what we mean by "idea." An idea is a potential solution to a problem or a new way of doing something. It's something that you can turn into reality with enough effort.

Not all ideas are created equal. Some ideas are better than others. To evaluate an idea, ask yourself these questions:

-Does this idea solve a real problem?
-Is this idea original?
-Is this idea feasible?
-Is this idea valuable?

What is the best way to organize your home?
There are many ways to organize a home, but one of the most popular and simple methods is to create a system where each room has its own individual category. This can help you focus on your career or other important responsibilities while still having plenty of space to relax and use your home as you please. Here are five tips on how to make this system work for you: 1) Create categories for bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, family areas, and other areas in your home. This will help you easier find what you need when it comes time to move or rearrange things. 2) Label each category with a relevant keyword or phrase. For example, if you have bedroom categories that include beds, walls, and chests of drawers, then they would be labeled Bedrooms, Walls, Drawers etc.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
