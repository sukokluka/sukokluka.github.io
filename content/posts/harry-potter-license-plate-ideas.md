When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.
