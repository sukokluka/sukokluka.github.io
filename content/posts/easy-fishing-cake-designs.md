2. Be open to new ideas. When you're open to new ideas, you're more likely to have them. So don't be afraid to try something new or think outside the box.

3. Be persistent. Creative thinking often requires trial and error. So don't give up if your first idea doesn't work out. Keep trying until you find something that works for you.
