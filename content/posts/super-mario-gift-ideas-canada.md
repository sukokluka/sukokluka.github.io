Trends in Health care
Healthcare is a constantly changing field, with new technologies and practices emerging every day.  In 2020, the global healthcare industry is expected to experience significant growth due to growing population sizes, various diseases, and increasing health demand. Ideas for how to capitalize on this growth are manifold, but one key trend that will be important in shaping the future of healthcare is the rise of virtual reality (VR).

The Importance of Commercializing Your Invention
Invention ideas are the lifeblood of the modern economy. They are the source of all new products and services, and they drive economic growth. Without them, we would be stuck in a world of old, outdated products and technologies.
So why is it so important to commercialize your invention idea? There are several reasons:

1. To make money: Obviously, this is the main reason why people commercialize their invention ideas. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, you can make a lot of money by bringing it to market.

2. To change the world: Invention ideas have the potential to change the world for the better. By commercializing your idea, you can bring your vision to reality and make a positive impact on society.

Definition of creativity: What does it mean for a person to be creative?
Creativity is defined in many ways, but at its root it is the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts that have never been thought of before. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to do something or coming up with a way to improve an existing product, creativity is always a huge part of any individual’s life. Some may say that creativity is having a good imagination, while others may say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box.

Invention: How does innovation happen?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new way to do something. Sometimes, this comes about through the sharing of ideas or the discovery of a new resource. Sometimes, it comes about through the development of a new product or service.
In any case, innovation happens in many ways and at different speeds. Here are four examples that illustrate how: 

1) Invention often happens spontaneously - people will often come up with ideas for new products or services while they are still working on other projects. 
2) Invention can be slow - sometimes it takes years for someone to develop a new product or service that is really useful. 
3) Invention can be fast - sometimes people can come up with ideas for products and services in minutes or even seconds.

Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They're the solutions to problems that have never been solved, and they can be the spark that ignites a company's competitive advantage. To find big ideas, your startup must first identify its biggest challenges and then identify the opportunities that could solve them. Then, you must come up with the best ways to execute on those ideas, and finally get your company off the ground by marketeering and publicizing your big ideas.
