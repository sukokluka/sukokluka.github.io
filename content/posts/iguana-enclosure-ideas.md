Creativedesigners on the go
Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

3. Keep Workspaces Clean: One way to stay focused while working is by keeping your workspace clean.

Tips for staying creative
Creativity is key to any business. Whether you're a creative individual or a small business owner, staying creative is essential for success. Here are some tips to help you stay creative: 
1. Consider your target audience: When thinking about how to be creative, it's important to consider what your target audience is. What are they interested in? What can you share with them that will interest them? This information can help you create content that will resonate with your audience. 

2. Create interesting ideas: When you have an idea for something, don't just go with the first thing that comes into your mind. Instead, think of ways that you could make this idea even more interesting and unique. This could involve coming up with different ideas for products or services, or creating a new concept that nobody has thought of before.

Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
