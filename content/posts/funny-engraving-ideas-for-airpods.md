What are some common pitfalls whenbrainstroming?
There are a few common pitfalls that people fall into when brainstroming.1) thinking too much about what they want to achieve or understand. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can in turn hinder productivity. It is important to remember that not everything needs to be done at once, and taking a step back can help clear your head and get back on track.
2) not specifically focusing on the task at hand. This can lead to people struggling with specific tasks or goals, which can make it hard to produce results. It is important to stay focused on the task at hand and set achievable goals rather than worrying about anything else outside of the task at hand.

3)procrastination.

Outcomes of Creative Ideas: What happens when you use creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be really helpful in terms of solving problems or improving the quality of a product or service. However, they can also have negative outcomes if not used correctly. Here are five tips to get the most out of creative ideas:
1. Make sure your ideas are sound. It’s impossible to come up with great ideas without some form of understanding what you’re trying to achieve. Make sure your concepts are clear, executable, and likely to work in practice.

2. Take a step back first. While it may be tempting to take things one step further and come up with something truly unique, doing so could actually backfire if it doesn’t have a real bearing on the problem at hand.
