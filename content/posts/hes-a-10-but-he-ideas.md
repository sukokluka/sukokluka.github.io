The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.

Outdoor projects: How to fix a broken window, install a new deck, or repaint your house.
If you're looking to fix a broken window or install a new deck, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some easy diy projects to get started:
1. Fix a Broken Window

One way to fix a broken window is to use your hands. Get some adhesive and put it on the inside of the windowpane. Once it's set, hold onto the edge of the adhesive and pull the window open. You could also use screws if the window frame is strong enough to hold itself together without help. If all of this doesn't work, call a professional!

2. Install a New Deck or Decking

Another option for fixing a broken window is to install new decking or railing. This can be done either in-home or at an outdoor location.

Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself. Sometimes all you need are a few good ideas and some creativity will come naturally. Here are four creative ways to get ideas from others: 
1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.

Definition of creative: How creativity works
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or concepts that are different from what is currently in existence. To be creative, one must have a strong imagination and be willing to experiment. Individuals who are creative often have an opposite view of what others think, which can lead to some interesting results.
