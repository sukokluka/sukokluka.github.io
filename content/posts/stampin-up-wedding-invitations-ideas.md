Definitions of creativity: What do they mean to us?
Creativity is a subjective term that can be defined in many ways. For some, creativity means being able to come up with new and innovative ideas. For others, creativity may mean taking risks and trying new things. However, the definition of creativity does not end there. There are many different concepts surrounding creativity which can help us understand its meaning for ourselves.
