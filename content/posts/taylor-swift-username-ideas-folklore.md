Creativity in the arts: Is There a True Definition?
Creativity in the arts is often said to be a matter of imagination and creativity. However, there is another definition that may be more applicable to the situation at hand. That definition could be called "the creative process." The creative process can take many different forms, depending on the artist or creatives involved. It can involve coming up with new ideas, brainstorming with others, and trying out different approaches until something feels right. In some cases, the creative process can even lead to success.

The difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions: Some key distinctions.
Some people might define brainstorming as coming up with ideas, while others might say that brainstorming is actually coming up with solutions to problems. In either case, the main difference between brainstorming and coming up with solutions lies in how the two activities are done.
In terms of how brainstorming is typically done, participants put together a list of ideas and then work on developing one or more possible solutions. This usually happens in small groups, which allows for each person to share their ideas and receive feedback.

Coming up with solutions, on the other hand, is typically a more solitary process. Participants typically work on tackle one or a few problems at a time and then come up with a plan to achieve their goals. Sometimes this occurs in group settings, but most times itâ€™s best if someone alone comes up with the solution to a problem.
