Creative Process: How do you come up with invention ideas?
Invention ideas are something that can be created easily and with little effort. To come up with them, you need to have a creative process in mind. This will help you come up with new ideas that could change the way the world does business or how we live our lives. Without a creative process, it can be hard to come up with unique and interesting inventions. The following tips can help you get started:
1. brainstorming is an essential part of creative process. When you have no idea what you want to create, brainstorming will help you gather information and develop ideas.

2. take your time when brainstorming. Don’t force yourself to think of ideas right away – allow yourself some time to calm down and relax before coming up with new ones.

The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge. This can make it difficult for them to identify opportunities for innovation and develop new products and services.

Another barrier to innovation is a risk-averse culture. Many firms are reluctant to take risks, preferring instead to stick with tried-and-tested methods.
