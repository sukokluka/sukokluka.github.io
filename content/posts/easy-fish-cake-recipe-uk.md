What are some ideas?
There are so many things to think about when it comes to ideas. Some of the most common are what to do, how to do it, and who to do it with. Here are a few ideas for you: 
-Start with a plan: What are your goals for this project? What should you focus on first? What obstacles should you overcome first? This will help you create a blueprint for the project that others can follow. 
-Work together: When starting a project, it’s important that everyone is on the same page. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and try to do everything yourself. Get someone else involved who can help make sure the project goes smoothly. 
-Think outside the box: There are always new ways to solve problems that haven’t been considered before.
