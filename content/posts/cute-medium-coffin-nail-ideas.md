The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project. Formal creativity entails using specific steps and techniques to complete a task or create an outcome. Ultra-formal creativity is based on the limits of what can be done or created. It means taking ideas to their extreme and seeing if there is still something that can be accomplished by pushing boundaries.

How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved. You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.
