Invention Displays: How can you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of protecting your invention from others who may want to make use of it. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application. Patent applications can take many months to complete, so it’s important to be prepared for the wait. There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original. If you have any trouble filing a patent application or if it takes longer than expected, don’t worry – there are plenty of resources available to help you out.

Choosing the right location for your small business
Small businesses are vital to our economy and society, but they can be difficult to manage on a budget. Here are some tips for choosing the best location for your small business. 
1. Consider your business size: A small business needs a space that is large enough to accommodate all of its employees and equipment, but not so large that it becomes difficult to operate. 
2. Consider your location: Your business should be located in a city or town that has a plentiful population and infrastructure, as well as good cultural amenities. 
3. Consider your expenses: You may want to consider the cost of living in your area before making a decision about where to set up shop. 
4.Consider the climate: If you plan on operating in cold or hot climates, make sure you have appropriate insurance and planning for cooling off times when necessary.
