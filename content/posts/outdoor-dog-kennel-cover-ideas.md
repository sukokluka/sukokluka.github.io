Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are a fundamental part of our lives. Whether we’re brainstorming for a project or just thinking, we need some ideas to help us along. Here are 5 classic ideas to get you started:
1. Come up with a title for your article. What is it? This will give you an idea of what your article is about and also give you some ideas for which topics to cover.
2. Start by answering the following question: What do people want? If you don’t know, think about it and come up with ideas that will fit the audience you’re targeting. 
3. How can you reach your target audience? There are many ways to do this, but one of the most popular is using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
