Types of creativity: The five types
Creativity is everywhere, and it's often difficult to distinguishing between the different types of creativity. However, here are five of the most common types of creativity:
1. Visual: Seeing things in a different way or making them come alive.
2. Perceptive: Understanding and application of new knowledge in order to create something new or improve an existing product or service. 
3. Analytical: Identifying problems and solutions in complex situations and then coming up with creative solutions. 
4. Impulsive: Acting on instinctive feelings or impulses without thinking about it first.
