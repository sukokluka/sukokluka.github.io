Types of creativity: There are three main types of creativity: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.
Creative art is a type of art that is created by combining different types of creativity. These include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic creativity. Visual creativity comes from seeing something new in an existing image or object. Audio creativity comes from hearing something new and then creating your own version of it.

The Challenge of Innovation: How do we stay ahead of the curve?
Innovation is a challenge for any organization, but it's especially hard to keep up with the curve when it comes to technology. Many times, innovation can come from scratch or from taking an existing product and changing its features or design. But whether it's something as simple as a new way of packaging food or a transformed business model, staying ahead of the curve can be tricky.
One way to overcome this challenge is to build on what others have done before. This can be done through collaboration and learning from others, as well as by listening carefully to what customers want and need. It's also important to focus on what customers want most, rather than just trying to please everyone.

There are several ways that an organization can stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.
