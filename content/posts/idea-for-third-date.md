The impact of technology on the world: How does invention impact our lives?
Invention has always had an impact on the world. For example, Revolutionary War leader George Washington was inspired to start the country’s first papermaking industry after seeing a difference in how British officers printed papers. Invention has also impacted our lives in more recent times with advances in technology. For example, since the invention of the television, we have seen a rise in communication and entertainment options that have led to a more interconnected world. Additionally, new technologies are being developed constantly, which means that there is always potential for innovation and new ways of living.

How to come up with big ideas
If you're looking for big ideas, the best way to come up with them is by brainstorming. It's an effective way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ways to think about problems or possibilities. If you're not sure how to do this, here are some tips:
1. Start by thinking about what you know. What are some of the things that have bedeviled you in the past? What have been some of your biggest challenges? Once you've gathered these information, it's time to start brainstorming potential solutions.

2. Be open-minded. Don't be afraid to change your mind if something comes up during your brainstorming session. After all, creativity is a risky business - it might be fun or it might not work - so don't be afraid to experiment!

Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.
