Creative ideas can be anything, but they all have to start with a cause. Sometimes all you need is an inspiration and a new perspective to see your idea from a different angle. When you have any creative ideas, take some time to brainstorm them over with friends or family. Once you have some good ideas, it's time to get started on creating your own unique project.

What are some ways to overcome them?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They can be inspiration or a way to take the next step. Here are three ways to overcome them:
1) Take a break: When it feels like you can't get started, take a break and come back with fresh eyes. With enough time, your new ideas will start to form and you'll be on your way to creating something great.

2) Get organized: Putting everything in one place will make it easier to focus on your project and won't leave any spaces for distractions. Keep track of what you're working on, where you want to go with it, and when you plan to finish so that you don't fall behind.

3) Talk to others: If you're feeling stuck, talking with other startups or experts can give you some great ideas and help get your project moving forward.

Lessons learned from producing innovation: What have been some successful methods of producing innovation?
Innovation can be defined in many ways but one way is as the production of new ideas or products that differ from those currently in use. It can also refer to the process of creating something new or different, whether it be an invention, a product, or a business plan.
One successful method for producing innovation is through collaboration. When two or more individuals work together, they are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that would not have been possible had they worked separately. This type of collaboration is what has been used in recent years to produce some very successful innovation successes.

Some of these success stories include Apple’siPhone and Google’s Android phone, which were both developed usingcollaboration rather than individual efforts. Other examples include BenQ’s monitors and Hewlett-Packard’s laptops.
