The power of collaboration:
When it comes to creative ideas, two heads are better than one. That’s the power of collaboration.
Working with someone else can help you come up with ideas you never would have thought of on your own. And it can also make the process more fun. But how do you find the right collaborator?

First, look for someone who has complementary skills to yours. If you’re a big-picture thinker, team up with someone who’s good at details. If you’re more of a doer, find someone who’s good at generating ideas.

Second, make sure you have similar goals and values. You want to be on the same page from the start so there are no surprises down the road.

Finally, trust your gut. Go with your instinct when it comes to choosing a collaborator.

The barriers to innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth. It allows firms to create new products and services and find new ways of doing things. However, innovation can be difficult to achieve. Firms face a number of barriers when trying to innovate, including a lack of resources, a risk-averse culture, and an unwillingness to change.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. Many firms do not have the money or the manpower to invest in new ideas. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge. This can make it difficult for them to identify opportunities for innovation and develop new products and services.

Another barrier to innovation is a risk-averse culture. Many firms are reluctant to take risks, preferring instead to stick with tried-and-tested methods.
