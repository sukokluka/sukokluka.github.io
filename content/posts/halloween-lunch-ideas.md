patenting inventions: What is the process of getting an invention patent?
There is the process of patenting inventions, which can be a long and difficult process. Patent applications must be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). After an application is filed, the USPTO will review it and may ask for changes or modifications. If approved, the application will then be sent to a full-blown prosecution process. This can take several months or even years. Once the full-blown prosecution process is complete, an invention may be registered with the USPTO as a trademark, trade name, or other intellectual property.
