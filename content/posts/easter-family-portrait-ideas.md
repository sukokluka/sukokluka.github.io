There are many different ways to think about creativity, and each person has their own definition. Some people define creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others may think of it as the ability to see things differently orto come up with unique solutions to problems. Still others may believe that creativity isn't about anything specific but simply creative thought and problem solving.
