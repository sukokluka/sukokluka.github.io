Main Points: New ideas can improve things like productivity, happiness, and social interaction.
The research on new ideas screams out for change - and that’s where the concept of “personalization” comes in. Personalization is the process of creating unique, customized experiences for customers by adding their own personality traits or preferences to products or services.
There are a number of benefits to personalizing your products and services, from making them more engaging to improving customer satisfaction. But there are also a number of drawbacks, including increased costs and decreased efficiency. So how can you personalize your products and services to create the most efficient and profitable outcomes?

One way is to consider what features your customers would want added to your product or service. This can help you focus on what makes your customers happy, rather than trying to cater too much to everyone.

The power of creativity: What makes creative ideas so powerful?
Creativity is a key ingredient in any successful business or organization. When it comes to creativity, there are three elements that have to be in place: an idea, a plan, and execution. Without these three elements, your creativity will be limited. 
The power of creativity comes from the combination of these three elements. If you can combine different ideas and come up with a plan that works, then your creativity will be amplified. But if you lack the creativity needed to come up with a great plan, then your ideas will be less powerful and less likely to work. 

The best way to increase your creativity is by practicing it regularly. This means learning how to come up with new ideas and coming up with plans that work well. When you have both the idea and the plan in place, your creativity will be at its highest level!

How to do brainstroming in your business: What are some tips?
Are you struggling to keep up with the ever-growing pace of business? If so, brainstroming may be the perfect solution for you. Brainstroming is a technique used in business that helps you stay focused and organized. Here are some tips on how to do it in your own business: 
1. Set goals and targets.

When you start brainstroming, it’s important to have specific goals and targets that you want to achieve. By setting these goals, you can ensure that your brainstroming efforts are directed towards achieving these rather than just talking about it without actually doing anything. 

2. Find a way to track progress.

One of the best ways to track progress during brainstroming is by using a goal tracker such as Goalilla or MorningStar.
