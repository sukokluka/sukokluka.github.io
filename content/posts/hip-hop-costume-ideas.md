How to Go about Gathering Ideas: How do you go about gathering them?
It can be tough to come up with ideas, especially when you don't know what you're looking for. However, there are a few things that can help. One is to think about the problem that you want to solve. Something that may help is brainstorming, which can be done by taking a walk or sitting down and thinking about everything that comes to your mind. Then, try coming up with several potential solutions. Another thing to consider is who you want to speak to. You might want someone who knows the industry well or someone who can give you an outsider's perspective on what's going on. Finally, make sure that you have something tangible in mind before starting any brainstorming process. This could be anything from ideas for products or services to pictures or examples of how things might work in practice.
