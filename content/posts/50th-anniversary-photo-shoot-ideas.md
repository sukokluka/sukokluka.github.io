What can be done to address them?
In recent years, there have been a number of proposals put forth to address the opioid epidemic. Some of these proposals include increasing access to treatment, distributing Narcan kits to civilians in need, and regulating prescription opioids. However, each proposal has its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are four examples:
1) Prescription opioids are highly addictive and can lead to addiction and death if not treated.
