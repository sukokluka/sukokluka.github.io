Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.

What are some invention ideas?
There are many invention ideas out there, and it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are a few tips to help you make the best choices:
1. Look at what others have done before you. If you're looking for an idea that's already been done, take a look at existing patents, copyrights, or other sources of inspiration.

2. Consider your target market. What is your target market? Are you looking for a specific audience or market? This will help you determine which invention ideas might be most successful for you.

3. Try multiple methods of experimentation. You don't have to duplicate everything that someone else has done before you; instead, try different methods of experimentation and see which ones work best for you.

4. Get feedback from people who know your target market well.
