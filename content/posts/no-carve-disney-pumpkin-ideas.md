Some of the latest wearable inventions include smart watches, sleeves that keep you warm, and even a smart coffee mug. With so many new ideas on the horizon, it's hard to know which one to try first. So here are four tips to help you make the best choice:
1. Check out what's in stock first: One of the best things you can do when trying out a new invention is to check out what's in stock. This will give you a good idea of what type of product might be available for purchase.
