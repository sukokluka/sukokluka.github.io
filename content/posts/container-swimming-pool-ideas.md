The power of big Ideas
Big ideas are the lifeblood of businesses and organizations. They can help change the course of history, create new products or services, solve difficult problems or change the way we live.
Here are four ways big ideas can help your business: 
1. Brainstorm new ideas with a group: With a few simple questions, you can generate dozens or even hundreds of potential ideas for your business. This way, you'll have a greater chance of coming up with something that will be interesting and innovative.
2. Test out new concepts: Once you've generated a number of potential ideas, it's time to test them out in an real-world situation. This means trying out different models, scenarios and models of how these products or services could work in order to see if they're actually feasible and profitable.

Future of work: How will work change in the future?
As the world continues to change, so too does the future of work. Artists and designers are already beginning to experiment with new ways of creating and working, while scientists and engineers are working on advancing new technologies that will change how we live and work. Some of these changes may come about as a result of technological advancements, others may be due to political or social movements. With so many different aspects at play, it's difficult to say for sure what the future of work will look like. However, some suggestions that have been made include: 
1) More automation – This could lead to a decrease in the number of jobs which require human interaction, but it could also create opportunities for those who are better suited for high-skill tasks.
