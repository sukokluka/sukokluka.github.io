Creative ideas: What should you include?
Creative ideas are a vital part of any business—not just creative businesses, but any business. Effective creative thinking can help businesses achieve their goals and improve their products or services. Here are some ideas to get you started:
1. Start with a mission: What is your company’s main purpose? What does it want to achieve? This will help you to define your creativity and make sure that all your ideas are focused on this one goal.

2. Define your target market: Once you have a mission, it’s time to define who your target market is. Who do you want to sell your products or services to? Do you want to attract people who already own certain types of products or services? Or are you targeting new customers who haven’t heard of your product or service yet?

New ideas are always exciting, no matter how old they may be. For example, consider the idea of a "universal basic income." This would be a monthly payment to every citizen that is free of charge, regardless of their income. This would help to encourage people to work and improve the economy. Additionally, there are many other potential ideas that could be implemented into society if given enough time and thought.
