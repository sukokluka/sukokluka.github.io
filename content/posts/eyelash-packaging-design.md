Creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life
Creativity is a key part of life and can be used to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and achieve goals. Here are some creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life:
1. Get inspired by nature: Look at pictures of natural disasters or scenes from around the world and think of creative ways you could incorporate them into your home or workspace. This can be a great way to bond with nature and get lost in the moment.
2. Try something new: When you have a blank canvas, try painting or sculpting without any preconceptions about what you will end up with. Just go for it! This can help you start thinking outside the box and come up with new ideas that might not have been considered before.
3. Get organized: When it comes to creativity, order is key.

How to overcome creative blocks:
When it comes to being creative, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. If you're feeling stuck, here are a few tips to help you overcome those creative blocks and get those ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, all you need is a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This can help refresh your mind and give you a new perspective on how to approach your project.

2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them. Hearing from others can jumpstart your own creativity.

Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!
