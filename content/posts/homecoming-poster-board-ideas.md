What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.

Why it's important to have a growth plan
It's important to have a growth plan because it sets expectations for the future and helps you stay on track. By knowing what you want, and how to get there, you can create an achievable plan that will help your business grow. Here are three key ideas to help build your growth plan: 
1. Know your industry and where you fit in. Knowing where your business is in the market and what competition is doing will help you determine what needs to be done next in order for your business to stay afloat. 
2. Create a market research strategy. Doing market research will help identify which channels work best for your audience and which ones need more attention or marketing investment. Doing this before starting any new project helps minimize surprises later on. 
3. Set realistic goals and timetables.
