Idea 3: Give people the freedom to experiment.
A recent study by a team at the University of California, San Diego suggests that giving people the freedom to experiment may be key to solving some of society’s most pressing problems. The study, conducted with the help of a grant from the National Institutes of Health, surveyed more than 4,000 people in 20 different countries and found that those who had greater access to freedom were more likely to engage in creative forms of problem-solving. The researchers say their findings could lead to new ways to solve problems and spur innovation.
