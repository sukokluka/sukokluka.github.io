Trends for Work/Life Balance
In the next few years, many people are looking for ways to balance work and personal lives. Here are some ideas for ways to make work life easier for everyone: 1. Make work a non-essential part of your day. This means that you should only be working when it is necessary and from what you are best suited for. If you have time off during the week, use it to take care of yourself or do something that you enjoy. 2. Try using technology instead of avoiding it. Technology can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it also can keep you from getting too involved with work. Make sure to set boundaries so that your time on the computer is only used for necessary tasks and not idle chat or gaming. 3. Find a job that fit both your skills and interests.

Ideas for Art and Design: What are some possibilities?
Creative ideas abound when it comes to art and design. From something as simple as a new piece of jewelry to an elaborate design for a home, there are endless possibilities when it comes to both. Here are a few ideas that photographer and creative writer Damon Knight has come up with himself:
1. A series of prints of artwork made from recycled materials. This could be turned into an exhibit or displayed in a public space to inspire others to think about how they can make their own slice of the world by recycling.
2. A set of kinetic sculptures that react based on the movements of the viewer. This could be used as part of a public installation or display in a museum.3. A mixed media piece inspired by nature that is both beautiful and functional.

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.
