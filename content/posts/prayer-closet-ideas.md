Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
Creativity is one of the most important aspects of our lives. It is what allows us to express ourselves, to come up with new ideas, and to problem solve. Without creativity, we would be stuck in the same routines day after day.
Creativity is not just for artists or musicians. Everyone has the ability to be creative in their own way. It is important to encourage creativity in children from a young age as it can help them in both their personal and professional lives.

There are many benefits to being creative, including reducing stress, improving mental well-being, and increasing cognitive skills. Creativity can also lead to happiness and a sense of fulfilment.

We all have the potential to be creative. It is something that we should cherish and nurture throughout our lives.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
