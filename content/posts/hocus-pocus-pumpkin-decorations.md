The power of big ideas
In a world where we are constantly inundated with information, it can be easy to get bogged down in the details and lose sight of the big picture. But as history has shown time and again, it is the big ideas that have the power to change the world.
Whether it’s a new scientific discovery, a groundbreaking political theory, or a revolutionary social movement, it is always the big ideas that make the biggest impact. And while not all big ideas are successful, it is often only through trial and error that we find out what works and what doesn’t.

So next time you feel like you’re getting lost in the noise, remember that it is the power of big ideas that has always driven progress forward, and that there is no limit to what we can achieve if we dare to dream big.

2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

What are creativity and art?
Creativity and art are two very different things. While they may have some things in common, such as the emotion they evoke, creativity and art truly differ in what they are.
