Some of the most significant benefits of innovations include increased productivity and efficiency, new ways to make products or services more affordable, and new ways to solve old problems.

Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one personâ€™s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.
