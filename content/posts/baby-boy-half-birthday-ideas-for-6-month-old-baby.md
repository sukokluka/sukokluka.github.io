Invention and technology: What is the difference between invention and technology?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product. Technology is the way that an invention is used. There are many different types of technology, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Invention and technology can make lives easier, but there are a few key differences that can make each one more important.

What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?
