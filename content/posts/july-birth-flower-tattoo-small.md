The Future of Work: What will be the defining characteristics of work in the future?
The future of work is still an open question, but many experts believe that the traditional workplace will become less and less significant. Workday lengths will be shortened, with employees working more hours for a lower wage. Other forms of work may also take over in some cases, such as self-employment or freelancing.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.

The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.
