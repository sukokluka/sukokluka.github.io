How do we create innovation?
Innovation is a process of thought, creativity and change that occurs in any company. It can be found in everything from the smallest idea to the biggest product. To create innovation, it’s important to have a clear definition of what you want your product or service to achieve, as well as how you plan on achieving it. Additionally, it’s essential to have a clear vision for the future and how your product or service will help make that vision a reality. Lastly, it’s essential to keep all of these things in mind when developing your product or service – otherwise you may find yourself at risk of becoming stagnant in your industry or at risk of becoming irrelevant.

Implementation: What are the steps involved in developing a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, implementation is key. In order to put your big idea into action, you'll need to have a clear plan and follow the steps involved in developing it. Here are some key things to keep in mind: 
1. Have a strong idea - before you can develop a plan for implementation, you need a strong idea of what you want your big idea to achieve. this may include laying out a clear vision or goal, answering key questions about what users would need and desires, and designing an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases your concept. 
2. Develop an MVP - Once you have a strong idea of what your big idea is, it's time to develop an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases it. This will help validate your hypothesis and get user feedback so that you can continue developing the product with greater confidence.
