Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.

10 New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
There are a number of ways to organize your home, and one way is to add storage space. One idea is to add a few shelves to the wall behind your TV or in the corner of the room where you keep your books, movies, and music. Another idea is to use an old cabinet as a makeshift storage unit. You can hang clothes in it, put books on top of it, or put toys in it. A third idea is to create a small interior shrine to your favorite thing. This could be a pottery jar with one of your favorite pieces of art inside, a picture from your childhood that you miss dearly, or any other piece of memorabilia that makes you happy. If you have children, they can help you select items for the shrine. Another way to organize storage is by using bins.
