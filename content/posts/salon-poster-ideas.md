Types of innovation: Product, process, service, and market.
Innovation is a key part of business. It allows companies to new ways of doing things and improve their products and services. Innovation can take many forms, including product, process, service, and market innovations. 
Product innovation is about coming up with a new way to do something. For example, a company could come up with a new way to make coffee that tastes better or be more environmentally-friendly. Process innovation is about making processes easier or faster so they can be done more efficiently. For example, a company could come up with a new way to produce food that is more consistent across different brands or produce food in less time than ever before.

For example, a company could create an online store that is easy to navigate or offer free shipping on orders over $70.
