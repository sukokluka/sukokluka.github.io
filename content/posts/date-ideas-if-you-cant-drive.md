The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

Invention and technology: How has innovation changed over the years?
Invention has always been a major part of human history. From the invention of fire to the development of cars, people have used their ingenuity to make new products and technologies. However, innovation has changed over time, as it has become more and more difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due to a variety of reasons, some of which are global in scope and others specific to each country or industry.
One example of how innovation has changed over time is in the field of telecommunications. With the advent of technology such as radio and television, people were able to communicate with one another far easier than they had ever before. This made it possible for businesses and governments to connect with a wider audience, which in turn led to increased profits and growth. However, while this change was beneficial overall, it also caused some problems.
