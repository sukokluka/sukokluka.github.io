Innovative thinking: How do we think differently to change things?
We all know that innovation is key to success in any business. But what does it mean when we talk about innovation?
Innovation can be defined as the process of designing, producing, and using a new product or service in order to improve the quality or usability of an existing product. There are many different ways to think about innovation, but four main themes will be used throughout this article:1) new ways of looking at old problems; 2) using technology to help solve problems; 3) breaking down barriers between ideas and reality; and 4) creating value for others. 

When you think about innovative thinking, you first need to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, itâ€™s important to explore different methods and concepts in order to find the most effective way to achieve your goals.
