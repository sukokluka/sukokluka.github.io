The benefits of Innovation
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or business ideas that are conceptually different from those currently in use. In order for an innovation to be successful, it must be novel, easy to adopt, and affordable. There are a number of benefits to pursuing innovation, including increased economic growth, better customer service and reduced costs. Some of the most common benefits of innovation include: 
Increased Economic Growth: Innovation can help businesses increase their profits by creating new products or services that are new and unique enough to draw in customers. By increasing competition, businesses can make more money while reducing their costs.

Improved Customer Service: When customers experience new products or services that are different from those currently in use, they may feel more satisfied with them. This will lead to higher sales and lower costs.
