Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers. 

Another type of innovation is process innovation. This occurs when companies improve the way they do something, such as developing a new manufacturing process or changing how they distribute products. Process innovations can have a big impact on the efficiency and profitability of businesses. 

Finally, there is service innovation. This refers to the development of new services that could not be produced by companies alone, such as software development or customer service.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.
