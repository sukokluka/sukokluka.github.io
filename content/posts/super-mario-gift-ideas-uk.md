The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.

what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.
