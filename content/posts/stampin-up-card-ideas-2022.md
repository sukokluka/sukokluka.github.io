What are some common pitfalls whenbrainstroming?
There are a few common pitfalls that people fall into when brainstroming.1) thinking too much about what they want to achieve or understand. This can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can in turn hinder productivity. It is important to remember that not everything needs to be done at once, and taking a step back can help clear your head and get back on track.
2) not specifically focusing on the task at hand. This can lead to people struggling with specific tasks or goals, which can make it hard to produce results. It is important to stay focused on the task at hand and set achievable goals rather than worrying about anything else outside of the task at hand.
