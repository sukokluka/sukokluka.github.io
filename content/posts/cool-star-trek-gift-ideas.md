The process of invention: Outline the steps that are involved in creating something new.
1. The process of invention generally starts with an idea. This could be something that you come up with yourself, or something that you see in the world around you.
2. Once you have an idea, the next step is to start working on it. This involves developing the idea further and turning it into a plan or a prototype.

3. The next stage is to test your invention. This could involve making sure it works as intended, or testing it out on a small scale before launching it onto the market.

4. Finally, once you're satisfied with your invention, it's time to commercialize it and bring it to the world. This involves marketing your invention and getting people to use it or buy it.

How do we become involved in the invention process?
Invention is a process where people come up with new ideas for products or services. It can be difficult to come up with new ideas, but there are many ways to get involved in the process. There are several ways to become involved in the invention process, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One way to become involved in the invention process is to attend an inventor's mixer. An inventor's mixer allows people to share their ideas with other inventors and potential customers. It can also help people develop their ideas more effectively.

Another way to become involved in the invention process is by working on a project with another person. When you are working with someone else, you have a better chance of developing your idea together and making it a reality. This is important because it can help you learn about other people's concepts and how they would approach solving a problem.
