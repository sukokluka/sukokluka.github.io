Overcoming blocks to creativity
When it comes to being creative, there are a lot of things that can hold us back. Whether it's fear, self-doubt, or just not knowing where to start, these blocks can keep us from coming up with great ideas.
But the good news is that there are ways to overcome them. By taking some time to understand what's holding you back, you can start to break through and come up with the creative ideas you've been wanting to have.

Here are a few tips for overcoming some of the most common blocks to creativity:

1. Fear of failure. Many people don't want to try something new because they're afraid of failing. But the only way to really fail is by not trying at all. So instead of letting your fear hold you back, use it as motivation to push yourself further.

2. perfectionism.

How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas.

The history of innovation
Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired. Another period during the 20th century saw an increase in innovation but also a number of failures and setbacks. In the 21st century, there is an increasing focus on innovation as businesses and individuals are looking to find new ways to improve their products, services, and economies.

Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.
