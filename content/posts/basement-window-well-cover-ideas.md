How to brainstorm effectively
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're doing it effectively. First, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you trying to achieve with this brainstorming session? Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can start generating ideas. It's helpful to write down every idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or far-fetched it may seem. You can always weed out the bad ideas later. The goal is just to get as many ideas as possible at this stage. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. This will help you start narrowing down your options and come up with a plan of action. Brainstorming can be a great way to generate new ideas and solve problems, but only if you do it effectively.

Overcoming Obstacles: How to overcome obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere, at any time. The key is to recognize them and act on them. However, there are some obstacles that may prevent you from coming up with a great invention idea. Here are a few tips on how to overcome those obstacles:
1) Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

2) Talk to people who are knowledgeable about the area you're interested in. They may have some great insights that you hadn't considered before.

3) Don't get discouraged if your first few ideas aren't winners. Edison famously said that he didn't fail, he just found 10,000 ways that didn't work. Every "failure" brings you one step closer to success.
