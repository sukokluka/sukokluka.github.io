What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

Conclusion: Why should we be worried about the future of innovation?
Innovation is one of the most important forces that drive economic growth and public satisfaction. However, some experts are concerned about the future of innovation because they believe that it may be at risk due to a variety of factors. Some of these include technological unemployment, global warming, and financial instability. If these issues continue to grow in severity, they could lead to significant reductions in innovation and public satisfaction. This could ultimately lead to declines in economic growth and social stability.
