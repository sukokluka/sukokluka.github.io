Businesses and technology: What are the implications of invention ideas?
Innovation ideas can have a wide range of consequences for businesses and individuals. Some of the most serious implications are the way in which technology changes how we do business, the protecibility of technologies, and how new business models are born. Other consequences could be more mundane such as how an innovation can impact customer service or how it might change the way products are marketed. All of these potential implications deserve careful consideration as businesses scramble to come up with new ways to exploit new inventions.

2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.
