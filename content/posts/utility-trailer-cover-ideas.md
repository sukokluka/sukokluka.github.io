Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.

What obstacles do they present?
A new approach to energy storage is being developed with the goal of overcoming some of the major obstacles to its widespread implementation. One obstacle is the need for large, expensive batteries that can be used in stationary or home applications. Another obstacle is the difficulty in fabricating lithium-ion cells that can withstand repeated charges and discharge cycles. However, a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University has created a new battery design that overcome both challenges and could soon be available for use in devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles. The new battery uses nickel-cadmium (NMC) cells instead of lithium ion cells to store energy, which makes it more environmentally friendly and cheaper to produce. The team's findings are published in an upcoming issue of Science Advances.

The art of creativity: What artists do and why they do it
Creativity is a wide and varied term, but it typically refers to the ability of artists to produce new works of art. This can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography, etc. but also in the form of ideas or concepts that are not necessarily physical. In many ways, creativity is an innate quality that all humans possess. It is something that is passed down from one generation to the next and something that can be cultivated through practice and hard work. While some people may find creativity a challenge to achieve, for others it can be a source of inspiration and guidance.
