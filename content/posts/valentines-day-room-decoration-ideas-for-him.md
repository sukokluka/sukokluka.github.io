Conclusion: Creative Thinking Tips for You
Creative thinking can help you come up with unique and innovative ideas. Here are a few tips to get started:
1. Keep your ideas open-ended – don’t have everything mapped out in your head before you start brainstorming. Be flexible and allow yourself to change and evolve your ideas as you think of more.

2. If you want to be really successful at creative thinking, keep things simple and achievable. Try not to overthink things or try to come up with too many solutions at once – just focus on the problem at hand and see where it leads.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no limit to what you can achieve when you take risks and try new methods.

what is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a group activity in which members of a team generate ideas and solutions to problems. The term was first coined by Alex Osborn, an advertising executive, in the 1940s. Brainstorming is often used in business settings as a way to encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. 
There are several different methods of brainstorming, but the most common is probably the round robin method, in which each team member takes turns sharing ideas. Other methods include free association, in which participants share ideas without restriction, and brainstorming with constraints, in which participants are given certain parameters within which to generate ideas. 

The effectiveness of brainstorming has been debated by some researchers, who argue that it can lead to conformity and pressure to conform to group norms.
