Creative individuals are often able to come up with new solutions to problems or ideas that other people may not have thought of before.

Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.

Definition of creativity in the business world: How do creativity and business connect?
Creativity and business are intertwined in a lot of ways. Sometimes it's difficult to define what creativity actually is, but there is definitely a connection between the two. 
In the business world, creativity is often used as a synonym for innovation. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or concepts that might not have been thought of before. In order to be successful, businesses need to be innovative in their approach to their product and services. For example, Apple has always been known for their innovative design and products. They are constantly inspired by new technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. This allowed them to continue expanding their empire even after they were first introduced to the world. 

On the other hand, creativity also goes beyond just doing things differently or having novel ideas.

Conclusion
Innovation is a process, not an outcome.
Innovation is often mistaken for creativity or ingenuity, but it is much more than that. Innovation is a process of turning creative ideas into tangible products or services. It is the implementation of new ideas, not just the generation of them.

This process requires more than just individual creativity; it also demands teamwork, tenacity, and resourcefulness. Anyone can be innovative if they have the right mindset and are willing to put in the hard work.
