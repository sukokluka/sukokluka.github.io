Business models: What are some innovative business models?
Invention ideas can be anything from a new product to a new business model. Here are some of the most innovative business models in the world:
1. The sharing economy: This is a model where people trade goods and services for each other. It is growing rapidly, with companies like Uber and Airbnb following suit.

2. The data-collection industry: This is a model where businesses collect data about their customers in order to sell them products or services. Datacollection has become increasingly important in today’s economy, as more and more companies need to know how their customers are interacting with them.

3. The crowdfunding industry: This model takes advantage of the generosity of people who want to support a project but don’t have enough money available to do so.

Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.
