The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:

And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?
