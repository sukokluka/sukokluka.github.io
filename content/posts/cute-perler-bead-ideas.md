What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

Pre-existing Conditions: What are some potential solutions to this problem?
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people looking for ways to help those who have pre-existing conditions. A variety of solutions have been proposed, with the most popular being increasing access to health insurance and creating new government programs that would help those with pre-existing conditions. However, each solution has its own set of disadvantages and drawbacks. One potential solution to this problem is increasing access to health insurance. This could be done through expanding Medicaid or creating new companies that offer affordable health insurance across all states. Additionally, increasing access to health insurance could also be done by reforming the Affordable Care Act so that it does not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act is a government program that helps people with pre-existing conditions get affordable health care.
