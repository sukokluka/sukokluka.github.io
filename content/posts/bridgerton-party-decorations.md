The Different Types of Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:
1. The brainstorming idea: This is the idea that you come up with without anything specific in mind. It's just a thought or an idea that pops into your head.

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.
