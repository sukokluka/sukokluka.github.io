brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are some basic types that you can use to come up with your own. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:
1. Brainstorm with others: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to brainstorm with other people. This can help you get feedback on what might work and what might not, and it can also help you brainstorm ways to make your ideas even better.

2. Take a walk: One of the best ways to come up with new creative ideas is to take a walk around your neighborhood or town. This will give you a lot of different ideas for things to do and places to go, and it will also give you some good motivation for coming up with new concepts.
