Historical Background of Invention: From ancient Greece to the American Revolution.
Invention is the act of bringing a new product to the market, or making a change in an old product so that it can be successful. It is often credited to individuals, gangs, and governments who come up with new ideas for fixing things or improving society. Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have been able to think about it. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop inventive minds and come up with new products. They invented everything from farming tools to missiles. Inventions played an important role in the development of civilizations and the rise of republics. The American Revolution was also led by inventors, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
