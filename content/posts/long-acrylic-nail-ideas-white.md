The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.
