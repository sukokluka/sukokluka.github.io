Future of Technology: What will the next big thing be?
As technology advances, there are always new and exciting possibilities for it to be used in different ways. One of the most likely examples of this is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has already been used in many different ways, such as helping people with their day-to-day tasks, but it is only in the future that it will be used to create truly intelligent machines. This would mean that we could see machines that can think and process vast amounts of data on their own, making them stronger and smarter than ever before. Some believe that AI will even lead to a future where we don't need humans at all – we could have automated civilizations running our lives on autopilot. If this happens, we would have to rethink a lot of things about what it means to live in a world where technology is the protagonist.

Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.
