The Creative Zone: When does creativity take over?
Creativity is a key word when it comes to deciding what to wear for the upcoming day. It can be an important factor in how someone looks and feels, and it can also lead to new ideas for products or services. However, creativity may not always take over when it comes to decisions about what to create. For some people, creativity might come out in their work or even their interpersonal relationships. However, others might find creativity less present in their lives and insteadocus more on practical things like solving problems or coming up with new ideas.
