The history of creative art: How did creativity dawn and what has been its most successful application?
Creativity has been around since ancient times and is one of the most popular applications of creativity in today’s world. One of its earliest incarnations was art, which began to be developed as a way to communicate with others. Art was used to depict beautiful things and express feelings, which is why it has been such an important part of human culture. From there, creative art started to be used in more practical ways, such as for making things that people could use or sell. It even went on to be adopted by businesses and other institutions, helping them produce more efficient products. With so many different applications for creativity, it is hard to say which one has been the most successful in terms of revenue and impact.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: What do you think about customer service?
Most people consider customer service to be a very important aspect of their overall business. There are many different ways that customers can contact customer service and these days, there are even online tools that allow customers to do this from anywhere. In addition, many businesses now provide live support during regular business hours, so customers can get help without having to wait in line or go through a long process.
However, there are still some complaints about how well customer service is done. Some customers feel that the staff is too busy or unhelpful and they don't receive the attention they need. Others find the processes difficult or time-consuming. In any case, it's important for businesses to ensure that they provide good customer service and that their employees are aware of how to treat those who visit them.

What should you do with your idea?
Ideas are always a valuable commodity, but there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to how to use them. Here are a few tips: 
1. Get started: It’s always important to get started with an idea, especially if it’s something you want to pursue for a long period of time. You won’t be able to think of anything else while your idea is simmering in your brain.

2. Come up with a solid plan: Once you have your idea, it’s important that you come up with a plan for taking it seriously. This will include figuring out what you want to achieve with your idea, what resources you need (time and money), and who you want to reach out to first (clients or potential customers).
