Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service.

Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.

This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.
