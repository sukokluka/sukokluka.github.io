Invention as an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution
Invention has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many creative minds have come up with brilliant new ideas. However, only a small percentage of inventions actually become products or services. This is due to the fact that invention is an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution. In order to make your invention successful, you must be able to come up with great ideas and have the hustle and determination to work on them tirelessly. If you are able to put in the extra effort, your invention will likely be more successful than those who just sit back and wait for someone else to create something for them.

Ideas for the environment: How can we conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment?
The future of the environment is important to all of us, and we need to find ways to conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment. Here are some ideas for the environment in 2022: 
1. Use organic materials when possible. This includes not just food, but also products made with natural ingredients. It can be tough to make this switch, but it’s worth it in the long run. 
2. Vehicle emissions need to be reduced. This will require concerted effort from both the government and businesses, but it’s something that we can achieve if we work together. 
3. Reduce energy use in homes and businesses. This can be done by retrofitting buildings or installing more efficient equipment. It’s important to take small steps rather than making drastic changes all at once, though. 
4. Foster a sustainable agriculture industry.
