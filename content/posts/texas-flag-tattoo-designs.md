It can be interpreted in many ways, but is generally seen as a form of expression that allows the artist to escape from reality and to view the world in a new way. Creative artists often use their creativity to explore new ideas and to create works that are unique and inspired by their experiences.

How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores).
