How can we create big ideas?
There are a lot of ways to create big ideas. You can think of big ideas as potential solutions to problems that you don't know how to solve.

What's important is that you have a good understanding of the problem, and the potential solutions you could consider. Here are some tips on how to generate big ideas:

The creative process: How do we go about creating art?
Creative process: how do we go about creating art?
In order to create art, there are a few key stages that must be gone through in order to produce successful pieces. Here are some tips on how to get started: 

1. Understand your purpose or vision for the artwork. Once you have a clear idea of what you want your piece to represent, it’s important to figure out how you want it to look. This can involve designing the layout and graphics yourself, or using free software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. 
2. Be honest with yourself and others. When starting out, it’s important not try to be too artsy or fancy. Just aim to create something that is interesting and engaging for your audience- whether that’s friends, family, or strangers.
