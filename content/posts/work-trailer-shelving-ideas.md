Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and find ways to make them work.
The invention process generally includes four steps: coming up with the idea, developing the idea, testing the idea, and commercializing the idea. Inventors typically use their creativity and knowledge to come up with an initial idea. They then develop that idea by doing research, making prototypes, and testing their invention. Once they have a working prototype, they commercialize their invention by marketing it and selling it to consumers.

Inventions can be big or small. They can be life-changing or just make someone's life a little easier. But all inventions start with an idea.

The types of creative art
Creative art is a form of expression that is unique to the individual. There are many different types of creative art, each with its own purpose and meaning.
Some common types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and music. Each type of art has its own way of conveying emotion and ideas. Painting, for example, can be used to express feelings or tell a story. Sculpture can be used to create a physical representation of an idea or feeling. Photography can capture a moment in time and Music can convey emotion and tell a story.

Creative art is important because it allows us to express ourselves in ways that words cannot always convey. It is a way to communicate our feelings and ideas to others. It can also be used as a form of therapy, as it can help us to process our emotions and release stress.
