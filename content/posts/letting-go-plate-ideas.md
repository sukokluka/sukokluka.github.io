The Evolution of Invention: From the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World
Invention is the process by which humans come up with new ideas, products, or methods. Innovation has been a part of human culture for as long as humans have been able to create things. The ancient Greeks were some of the first to come up with inventions. They had a system in which they would submit new ideas to a panel of judges, and if they were found to be good, they would be printed out and given to other people. The judges would then use their judgement to decide who should get the idea and who should make it into a product.
The modern world is full of invention. We have technology that allows us to create anything we want, and we can also find ways to improve on what others have created before us. This makes innovation something very important for humanity.

History of Invention: How did inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, but the most common origins are as a result of inspiration or thought. Inventions can come in many forms- from simple devices to complex machines. Sometimes, an idea for a new product is born out of pure boredom or curiosity. Other times, an inventor may simply have the perfect solution to a problem that he or she has been experiencing. Whatever the case may be, history has shown that inventors often come up with new ideas based on their own experiences and observations.

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.
