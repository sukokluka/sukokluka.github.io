In recent years, scientists have developed new ideas about how the brain works. One of these ideas is that the brain is divided into two parts, the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher functions such as thinking, planning, and decision making. The hippocampus is responsible for memory storage and retrieval. These new ideas may help explain some of the psychiatric problems that people experience, such as depression and anxiety.
