Conclusion: the benefits of creative art
Creative art is often thought of as a luxury, something that only the wealthy can afford to enjoy. However, the benefits of creative art are not just financial; they are also emotional and mental.
Creative art can help people to express themselves in ways that they may not be able to do with words. It can also be a way to release bottled-up emotions and feelings. For some people, creative art is a form of therapy that helps them to deal with difficult life events or traumas.

The benefits of creative art go beyond the individual. When people create art together, it can help to build bridges between cultures and communities. It can also be used as a tool for social change, raising awareness about important issues such as environmentalism or human rights.
