What are some ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many to choose from. Here are a few that stand out to us:
-Start with what you know. What are your interests and passions? What do you like and don't like in the world around you? Start with that and work from there.

-Think outside the box. If you're not sure what to do, think about what other people have done or said that might be of interest to you. This can give you some great ideas for things to try or projects to take on.

Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.
