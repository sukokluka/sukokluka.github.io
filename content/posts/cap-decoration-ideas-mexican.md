The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

What are the benefits of creativity?
Creativity is a key component of success in any business or professional setting. The ability to come up with new and innovative ideas is a valuable asset, which can help you achieve your goals. There are many benefits to creativity, including improved communication and problem-solving skills, as well as more efficient and effective workflows. Here are four ways creativity can benefit your business: 
1) By broadening your perspective – when you take on new challenges, you often come up with new solutions that aren’t possible before. This opens up opportunities for innovation and growth; 
2) By developing new strategies – if you can find ways to improve on what others are doing, your business will be more successful. This can include coming up with novel ideas for marketing or sales campaigns, or finding creative ways to make products or services more attractive to customers.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.
