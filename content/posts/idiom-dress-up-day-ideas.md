What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas:
