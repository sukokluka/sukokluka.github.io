What is customer service and how do you provide it?
Customer service is a term that is often used interchangeably with customer relations. It refers to the various methods through which customers can interact with companies and receive the service they need. From calling in for a repair to speaking with a supervisor, there are many ways to get help from your company.
There are two main types of customer service: face-to-face and online. Face-to-face customer service allows customers to interact with employees directly. Online customer service is more common, but it can also be accessed from computers or devices. This type of customer service provides a variety of options for customers, including webinars, chat rooms, and social media platforms.

Both types of customer service have their own strengths and weaknesses.
