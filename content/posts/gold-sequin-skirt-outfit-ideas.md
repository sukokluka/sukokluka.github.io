The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.

Types of innovation: Product, process, service, and market.
Innovation is a key part of business. It allows companies to new ways of doing things and improve their products and services. Innovation can take many forms, including product, process, service, and market innovations. 
Product innovation is about coming up with a new way to do something. For example, a company could come up with a new way to make coffee that tastes better or be more environmentally-friendly. Process innovation is about making processes easier or faster so they can be done more efficiently. For example, a company could come up with a new way to produce food that is more consistent across different brands or produce food in less time than ever before. Service innovation is about making services better or easier to use so customers can have better experiences. For example, a company could create an online store that is easy to navigate or offer free shipping on orders over $70.
