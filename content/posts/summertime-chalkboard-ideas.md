Concluding thoughts on big ideas.
In recent years, big ideas have come to the forefront of many people's minds. Some of these innovative concepts are new and exciting, while others are more general in nature but still important in terms of advancing humanity.

Artificial intelligence is one big idea that has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Many experts believe that this technology can be used to create intelligent machines that can do a majority of the work for us- from cleaning and grocery shopping to driving and making decisions on things like politics and industry. If this technology does become reality, it would be huge news, as it would mean that we could no longer rely on humans to make most decisions for the world.
