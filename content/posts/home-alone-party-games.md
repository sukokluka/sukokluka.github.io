getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.

Ideas for New Products: What new products are being created that could be appealing to people?
New products are being created all the time that could be appealing to people, such as new transportation options, wellness advancements, and more. It is hard to come up with a specific idea for a new product, but here are some possibilities: 1. A bike-sharing service that would allow people to use bikes to get around town instead of having to take public transportation. This could be especially helpful for those who live in complexes or have difficult access to public transportation. 2. A weight loss supplement that was made specifically for women and would help them lose weight and reduce their risk of heart disease. 3. An aromatherapy inhaler that could be used for general health benefits or for aromatherapy applications such as treating stress and anxiety.
