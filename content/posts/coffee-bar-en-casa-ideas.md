Patents: What are the benefits and challenges of patents?
Patents are a form of intellectual property that allows an inventor to protect their ideas for products or services with a certain number of years after they come up with them. There are many benefits to patents, including helping to protect the inventor's intellectual property, increasing the chance that their idea will be developed into a successful product or service, and increasing the potential for royalties and other financial compensation that may be available to the inventor. There are also some challenges to patents, including ensuring that the invention is actually protected by a patent and that it is not copied or used without consent from the inventor.

what are big ideas?
What are Big Ideas?
In education, a big idea is a broad concept that provides a unifying structure for a lesson or unit. It helps students connect new information to what they already know and understand. Big ideas should be open-ended and complex, allowing students to explore them in depth.

Big ideas help students see the world in new ways and make connections between different concepts. They encourage higher-level thinking and promote deeper understanding. When students can articulate the big ideas in a subject, they have mastered the essential content and skills.

Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!
