3rd idea:
If you're looking for ideas, you've come to the right place. Here are three of the best places to find them.
1. The internet - There's no shortage of ideas on the internet. You can find them in blog posts, articles, and even in the comments section of your favorite websites.

2. Books - Sometimes the best ideas are hiding in plain sight. Crack open a book and see what inspiration you can find between the pages.

3. Your own mind - Don't underestimate the power of your own brain. Sometimes the best ideas are the ones that come from within.
