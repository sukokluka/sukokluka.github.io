Definition: Innovation is the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created.
definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created. This definition could be used to describe many different aspects of innovation, but some are more important than others. For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

There are a few different ways to achieve innovation. One way is to brainstorm new ideas and see if anyone has any that you think could work well. Another way is to test out products or services before they're released to see if they work well and if there's enough demand for them. There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.

How can a big idea be turned into a reality?
In business, big ideas are the lifeblood of success. They can be turned into reality with the right planning and execution. Here are five tips to make your big idea a reality:
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. When you know what your goals are, it's easier to prioritize and figure out how to reach them. This will help you draft an effective plan that will help you achieve your goals.

2. Make sure you have a compelling case for your big idea. Most businesses only do their best when they have a strong argument for why their product or service is worth existing. Make sure your case is clear, argumentative, and compelling enough to convince people to invest in your project - even if it's just for a couple of years!

3. crystallize your ideas into simple concepts.
