The challenges of innovation: risk taking, competition, and change.
The challenges of innovation risk taking, competition, and change are three of the most important factors that affect the success of any business. Innovation can be risky, as it often means changing or adapting products or services in order to stay ahead of the competition. It can also be expensive, as it requires a lot of creativity and effort to bring new concepts to market. Finally, change often brings with it new risks and challenges – such as those related to innovation risk taking itself.

Brainstorming techniques
If you're stuck on how to generate creative ideas, try some of these brainstorming techniques:
1. Freewriting: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write nonstop about your topic. Don't worry about grammar or whether what you're writing makes sense. The goal is to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

2. Brainstorming with someone else: Collaborating with someone can help stimulate new ideas. Throw around some potential ideas with a colleague or friend and see what they come up with.

3. Taking a walk: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and get some fresh perspective is to take a break from work altogether. Go for a walk outside and let your mind wander. You may be surprised at the new ideas that come to you when you're not even trying to think of them!
