A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.
