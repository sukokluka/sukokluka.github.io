Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project â€“ sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge â€“ sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.

Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you donâ€™t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.
