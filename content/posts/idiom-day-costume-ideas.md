Innovation in business: What are some examples of how innovation can be used in business?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or innovation that can solve a problem. Innovation can be used in business in many ways, from improving the efficiency of a business to creating new products or services. Here are some examples: 
1. Inexpensive home-theater systems could be replaced by more expensive models that use 3D projection technology to create an immersive experience. 
2. A company that produces respiratory masks could find new ways to market their products, such as using social media to reach more people in need and airing adverts on television stations across the United States. 
3. The production of chocolate could be improved by using insects as fermentation tanks instead of milk cows to make chocolate more nutritious and less costly.

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.

How can we come up with big ideas?
The best ideas come from a brainstorming session. Sometimes, it’s just easier to think broad thoughts when you have a lot of different ideas in your head. Here are some tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of different ideas in your head, it can be difficult to remember which ones are the most important. The best way to organize these ideas is by having a main idea and then going from there. This will help you keep track of what you’re working on and make sure that it’s always relevant to your main idea.

2. Take advantage of technology: Technology has helped us massively in the past when it comes to coming up with big ideas. By using tools like Google Earth or yellow boards, we can easily brainstorm and keep track of our thoughts as we go.
