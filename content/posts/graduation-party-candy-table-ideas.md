brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but there are some basic types that you can use to come up with your own. Here are some creative ideas to get you started:
1. Brainstorm with others: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to brainstorm with other people. This can help you get feedback on what might work and what might not, and it can also help you brainstorm ways to make your ideas even better.

2. Take a walk: One of the best ways to come up with new creative ideas is to take a walk around your neighborhood or town. This will give you a lot of different ideas for things to do and places to go, and it will also give you some good motivation for coming up with new concepts.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

What are some bad ideas?
The following are some bad ideas that people come up with all the time. Some of these ideas are really stupid and not good for anything, but they get thrown around a lot and people think they might be good. So, here are some of the worst ideas:
1) Making cars into machines. This is a really bad idea because it will make the cars more efficient and faster, but it will also make them more expensive to maintain.
2) Giving away free stuff. This is another bad idea because it won’t help anyone and it’s going to make people less likely to buy things.
3) Creating welfare programs that only benefit the wealthy. This would be a really bad idea because it would create a lot of competition among businesses and it would drive up prices for goods and services.
4) making school harder than necessary.
