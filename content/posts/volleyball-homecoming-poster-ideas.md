The bottom line: the benefits of brainstorming
The benefits of brainstorming are well-documented and undisputed. Brainstorming allows individuals to generate new ideas, build on existing ideas, and create solutions to problems. Brainstorming also fosters creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.
Despite the clear benefits of brainstorming, many people still hesitate to engage in this type of thinking. One reason for this may be the fear of judgement or criticism. Others may simply not know how to brainstorm effectively.

Fortunately, there are a few simple guidelines that can help make brainstorming more productive and less intimidating. First, it is important to suspend judgement during the brainstorming process. This means that all ideas should be welcomed and explored, no matter how “out there” they may seem at first. Secondly, it is helpful to set a time limit for each brainstorming session.

Creative process: What happens during the creative process
Creative art is a process that can take many different forms. Some people might say that the creative process is all about ideas, while others might say that it's all about the finished product. Whether you're saying or doing something during the creative process can make or break your project. Here are 8 tips to help you get started: 1) Be open to new ideas. It's important to be willing to try different things and see what works best for you. 2) Take time for yourself. This will help you stay focused on your project and not become bogged down by everything else around you. 3) Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are always people who can help with tasks that aren't related to painting or drawing, and they'll be more than happy to do so.
