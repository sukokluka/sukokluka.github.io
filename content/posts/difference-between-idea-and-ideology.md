The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why it’s important for them to invest in your project.

How do we create innovative products?
Innovation is the ability to create new products or services that solve a problem that was not previously considered. For some businesses, innovation can come from coming up with a new way to do something, getting better at what you do, or even creating something entirely new. In other cases, innovation can come from taking an existing product and making it better. Sometimes this is easy- like when a business comes up with a new way to make their product more efficient- and sometimes it takes more effort, like when a company comes up with a revolutionary new technology. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to stay ahead of the curve and give their customers the best possible experience.

Invention is the process of designing, creating, and applying a new solution to a problem. It is a process that includes many steps, from identifying a need or opportunity, to generating ideas, to testing and refining prototypes. Invention is often driven by necessity, but it can also be sparked by curiosity or a desire to improve upon existing solutions. Whether driven by necessity or curiosity, invention requires creative thinking, perseverance, and often a willingness to fail.
