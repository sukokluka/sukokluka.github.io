Innovation processes: How does an inventor go from idea to product?
Invention processes can vary significantly depending on the inventor's background and experience. Generally, an inventor will need to generate a number of different ideas in order to come up with a product that is new and exciting. This might include generating concepts for products, working on prototypes, or even coming up with new business models.
One important factor that will affect the invention process is the inventor's willingness to risk failure. If the inventor feels that their idea is too risky or if they do not believe that it can be turned into a successful product, they will likely not go ahead with it. In addition, the inventor's skills and knowledge might also be needed in order to create a successful product.
