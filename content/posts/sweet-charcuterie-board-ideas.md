Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.
