Conclusion: Some tips for coming up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ideas for products or services. Here are a few tips to help you come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, it is helpful to take turns sharing your ideas. This will allow you to gain feedback and improve on what you’re thinking.

2. Use analogies and metaphors: Analogies and metaphors are powerful tools for coming up with new ideas. For example, if you’re brainstorming product concepts, you might compare a toy to a Ferrari or a computer game to the cockpit of an airplane.

3. Take advantage of opportunity: Opportunity is the key to creativity, and taking advantage of it will help you come up with more creative solutions than you would have otherwise thought possible.

Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.
