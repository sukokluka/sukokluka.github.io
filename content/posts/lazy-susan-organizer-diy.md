The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the key to success in any field. By exploring and applying big ideas, you can realize your full potential and achieve great things. Here are a few tips on how to create big ideas that will help you throughout your career:
1. Make sure your ideas are realistic – don’t overthink things or hype them up too much. If your idea is unrealistic, it won’t be taken seriously and you’ll end up wasting time and energy on something that won’t pan out.

2. Be patient – take your time in developing your big idea and make sure it isn’t just a one-time project. As you develop it, make sure to keep track of the results so that you can measure how well it was received by the audience.

Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.
