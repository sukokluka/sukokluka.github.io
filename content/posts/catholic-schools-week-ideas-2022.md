2nd idea:
If you're stuck on what to do next, don't worry—you're not alone. We all have moments where we feel uninspired, whether it's in our personal lives or our work. The good news is, there are plenty of ways to get your creative juices flowing again.
Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work for a little while. You may find that when you come back, you have a fresh perspective and can approach your project with new energy.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling lost, talking to someone who is creative can give you some great ideas.

Creative ideas: What are they?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. They can be things as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or something much more ambitious. But whatever they are, they need to be on the mind of someone who is thinking about creativity and its role in their work. Here are some creative ideas to get your creative juices flowing: 
1) Create a new way of visualizing an old problem. One way to explore this would be to take a different view of a familiar problem. For example, you might think about how to visualize a situation where you have no idea what will happen next. This could lead to some interesting brainstorming sessions! 
2) Take on an unconventional challenge. Another way to get creative is by taking on an unconventional task that you know you can do but that others might not think of as being creative.
