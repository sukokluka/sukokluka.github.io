Origin of invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for a product or service?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea, or designing something that has not been done before. It can be anything from a simple invention to a groundbreaking product or service. The key to coming up with an innovative idea is to have an original solution that nobody else has come up with before. There are many different ways someone could come up with the idea for a product or service, and it all depends on what the person is trying to achieve. Some people come up with ideas while they are sleep, others work on them for months or even years before finally achieving success. However, the most important thing is that the person takes their time in coming up with an innovative solution.
