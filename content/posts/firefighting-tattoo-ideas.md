Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play. But innovation can be a challenge, as it often requires fresh thinking and new ways of looking at old ideas. Here are some challenges associated with innovative thinking:

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.
