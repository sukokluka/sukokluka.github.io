Here are three key Takeaways from the past several years of big idea development: 
1. Big ideas can be successful if they're based on sound principles and backed up by research.
2. The risks associated with big ideas can impact their success or failure, and those risks need to be considered when developing them.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work.
