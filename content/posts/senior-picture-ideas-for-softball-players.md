Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).

The environment: How will the world be able to handle climate change?
Climate change is something that has been happening for a while now, and it is only going to continue to happen as the Earth continues to warm. Some people are saying that we need to do something about climate change, but what do they want to do? There are many ideas out there, and it will be difficult to come up with a one-size-fits-all answer. Some people want us to go independent of oil, while others want us to reduce our CO2 emissions. It really depends on what you think is the best way to handle climate change.
