Overcoming Obstacles to Innovation
Innovation is critical to the success of any business, yet it can be difficult to achieve. There are a number of obstacles that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a fear of change, and a lack of creativity. However, there are ways to overcome these obstacles and create an environment that is conducive to innovation.
By identifying the obstacles that are standing in the way of innovation, businesses can take steps to remove them. One of the most common obstacles is a lack of resources. This can be addressed by allocating more funding to research and development or by partnering with other companies that have the resources needed.

Another obstacle that can impede innovation is a fear of change. This may be due to a reluctance to embrace new technologies or a fear that change will lead to disruptions in the business.

The challenges of brainstorming
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are certain challenges that can arise.
2. One challenge is that people can get too caught up in trying to come up with the "perfect" idea, and as a result, they can become frustrated and discouraged.
3. Another challenge is that people can get too focused on one particular idea, and they may not be open to other possibilities.
4. The key to successful brainstorming is to keep an open mind and to try to generate as many ideas as possible.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of coming up with a new and original idea or approach to something. It can be anything from a new product or service to an innovative way of running a business. There are many types of innovation, but some are more popular than others. Here are four examples:
1. Creative invention – This type of innovation comes from coming up with an original solution to a problem that someone else had before you. This can be something as simple as creating a new type of bread recipe or developing a way to cut costs in your business.

2. Collective intelligence – This is when two or more people come up with an idea for solving a common problem and then work together to make it happen. This can be something as simple as coming up with a better way to stock shelves or finding new ways to sell products.
