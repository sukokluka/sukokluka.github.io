The impact of technology on society: How will the impact of technology change society?
The impact of technology on society has been debated for years, but no definitive answer exists. In 2022, a group of researchers from Northeastern University released a report which suggests that technology will have a major impact on society. The report reflects on the future of technology and how it will affect different aspects of our lives, including work, education, and family life. 
One potential outcome is that more people will be employed through digital means. This could lead to an increase in income and wealth for those who can afford it, as well as fewer jobs available for those who cannot. It is also possible that this trend will lead to an increase in stress levels and tension within families. This could cause problems such as decreased productivity at work or increased absenteeism. 

Another potential outcome is that society may become more democratic.
