Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of designing, testing, and applying new concepts or products to solve a problem. Innovation can be achieved through both unilateral and cooperative efforts. Unilateral innovation occurs in the absence of any externally requested assistance, while cooperative innovation occurs when two or more organizations collaborate to create a new product or concept.
