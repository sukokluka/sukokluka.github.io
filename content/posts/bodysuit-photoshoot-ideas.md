4th idea:
There are a lot of ideas out there. How do you know which ones are worth pursuing? And how do you come up with new ideas in the first place?
Here are four ways to come up with better ideas:

1. Be open to new experiences

If you want to have more and better ideas, you need to be open to new experiences. That means trying new things, meeting new people, and exposing yourself to new ideas. The more experiences you have, the more material you have to work with when it comes time to generate new ideas.

2. Be persistent

Coming up with good ideas is hard work. Don't expect to have a great idea every time you sit down to brainstorm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of trial and error. The key is to keep at it until you find that one winning idea.

Inventions have the potential to change the way people live and work, and they have also helped to bring about advances in technology and science.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.
