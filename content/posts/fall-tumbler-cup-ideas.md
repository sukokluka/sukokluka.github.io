Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

Conclusion: Why should we be interested in innovation?
Innovation is an ever-growing field of science and technology that is changing the way we do things. It offers a new perspective on how to improve products, services and ideas. Innovation has the ability to change the course of history, and it’s important for businesses to be interested in it. Here are four reasons why innovation should be on businesses’ radar:
1) Innovation can create new opportunities: When companies explore new ways to produce or distribute their products or services, they can find new customers and potentially new markets. This can lead to increased profits and growth.

2) Innovation can save money: Innovation often leads to cost savings, which can help make businesses more profitable. For example, imagine a company that finds a way to produce a product without using traditional methods. This could lead to significant savings in production costs.
