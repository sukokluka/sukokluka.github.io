The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
