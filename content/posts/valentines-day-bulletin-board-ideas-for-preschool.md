What are big ideas?
In recent weeks, we've heard a lot about big ideas. Ideas that could change the world, ideas that could make your company better, and ideas that could revolutionize how you do business. But what are big ideas? And how can they be used to improve your business? Here are some tips: 
-Think about the potential implications of your idea. What could it mean for customers, employees, or competitors? 
-Generate ways to test and measure the effectiveness of your idea. What would people say if they had access to this new product or service? How would you market and sell it? 
-Make sure you have a clear vision for your idea. What does your business need in order to achieve its goals? What does this new product or service offer that others don't? How will customers feel about using it?
