The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
1. Make sure you have an EMPATHY FOR THE TOPIC YOU ARE FOCUSING ON.

Before beginning brainstroming, it is important to have an understanding of the topic you are trying to focus on. If you don’t care about the issue at hand, your mind will become clouded with distractions and it will be difficult to find the energy necessary to focus on the task at hand.
