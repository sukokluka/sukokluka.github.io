1) You can communicate more effectively – when you have a consistent flow of content, your readers will be able to see what you’re trying to say without having to read every sentence. This will help you to sounds smarter and more articulate when it comes time for debates or speeches. 
2) You can build up an audience – by sharing your voice with others, you’re opening yourself up to new people who might be interested in what you have to say. This could lead to new customers or opportunities for marketing campaigns.
