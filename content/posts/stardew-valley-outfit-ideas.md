A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

Idea #2: Get inspiration from other cultures or websites
Inspiration can be found in many places, including websites and cultures. If you are looking to get your ideas for new designs or products from other sources, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, take into account the tone of the website or culture you are looking to emulate. If it is lighthearted and fun, then copying that style will likely be successful. However, if the website or culture is moreserious or educational, then it is important to think about what type of ideas could be included on the site or product. Additionally, think about what type of message the site or culture wants to send. If you want to copy their style but add your own unique spin on it, make sure to do so in a way that is enticing and relevant to the target audience. Finally, always remember that inspiration comes from everywhere and not just from specific websites or cultures.
