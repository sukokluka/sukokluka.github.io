The Importance of New Ideas: What would be the consequences of not having any?
The importance of new ideas is often overstated, but without them, society would be in a very different place. Not having any new ideas means that the world would be more stagnate and uninteresting. This lack of innovation could have serious consequences for our economy and society as a whole.

Why creativity is important: What does it mean for business and life?
Creativity is important for business and life. It can mean new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply a different perspective on an old problem. In most cases, creativity is essential for businesses and people to continue their momentum and grow in their careers. However, it can also be dangerous to rely exclusively on creativity alone to solve problems, as it can quickly become exhausted and stale. There are a few factors that help to keep creativity fresh and ongoing, and these are key to success in any field: having a diverse range of ideas, keeping our imaginations active by letting them roam free, developing our creative abilities over time, being comfortable with risk and uncertainty, and always looking for ways to improve upon what we’ve done before.

Trends in mobility: How is mobile technology affecting business and how will it impact the future of work?
Mobile technology is slowly but surely affecting business as more and more people move around the world. This has a big impact on the future of work, as businesses have to adapt to the needs of their customers who are increasingly using mobile devices for work purposes. Here are some ideas for how mobile technology will affect business in 2022:
1) The rise in mobile phone ownership: In 2020, over 50% of Australians had a mobile phone, up from just 25% in 2009. This has led to a big increase in the demand for data and voice services. As people becomemore reliant on their phones for work purposes, companies need to be prepared to offer good deals on data and voice rates.

2) The shift towards digital working: Technology has been gradually getting better at letting people collaborate through electronic means.

Invention: How did the inventor come up with their idea?
Invention ideas come from a variety of sources, including inspiration, observation, and trial and error. The inventor typically starts with an idea that they believe in and then looks for ways to improve on it. They may also reference others who have had similar ideas to help them come up with their own version of the idea. Once they have a good idea, they continue to explore ways to make it more effective or efficient.

The Future of Work: What needs to be done to keep people employed?
There is no doubt that the future of work is fraught with uncertainty. There are many reasons for this, but one big factor is the increasing use of technology. The way that technology affects work and jobs is changing constantly, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends. Some ideas that could help to keep people employed include: 
1) More job flexibility – as technology advances, it becomes easier and more affordable for people to change their working hours or locations whenever they feel like it. This means that there are more opportunities for people to work from home, which can be a great way to stay on top of your schedule and stay organized. 
2) Better communication between employers and employees – not everyone needs the same level of communication when it comes to working with their boss.
