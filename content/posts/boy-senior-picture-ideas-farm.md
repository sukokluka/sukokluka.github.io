The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Causes and Effects of Innovation
Innovation can have both positive and negative effects on economies. Sometimes, innovation can lead to new ideas and products that are better than what is currently available. However, sometimes innovation can also lead to companies becoming too comfortable with their current products and services, or even failing to take advantage of new opportunities that come along.
