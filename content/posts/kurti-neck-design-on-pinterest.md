How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

Origins of innovation: How did people get inventive ideas?
Invention ideas come from a diversity of sources, from people who are just starting out, to those who have been working on something for years. But there are some key elements that are always in play when someone comes up with an innovative idea. These include the idea itself, and how it can be realized. For example, a person might come up with the idea of a new product or service, but may not have any clear ideas about how to make it happen. To get started, they need to have some conception of what they want their invention to do and how it could be used. From there, they can work on coming up with a way to make their idea a reality.

How does creativity work? How do artists create their unique works of art? What is the difference between creative and non-creative art?
Creativity is a complex and mysterious process that scientists still do not understand. Some artists say that creativity comes from the need to find a new way to approach an old problem. Creative people are often risk takers, and they often use their imagination to come up with ideas that might not have been thought of before. There are two types of creativity- creative art and non-creative art. Creative art is usually more time-consuming, but it can be rewarding because it can lead to new insights or ideas about the world. Non-creative art is less time-consuming, but it may not lead to new insights or ideas about the world.
