What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or idea. Invention can be found in everything from developing a new recipe for a sauce to coming up with a new way to do something. The goal of invention is to improve the quality of life for people, and sometimes this involves coming up with a solution that no one else has thought of. Inventions have made so many lives better, and we owe it to those who have helped make our world better by sharing their ideas.

The future of innovation
The future of innovation is exciting, but it also has a lot of potential drawbacks. Many experts believe that innovation can be used to create new products and services that are more efficient, more affordable, or even more dangerous. However, these benefits often come with a cost – the creativity and ingenuity of the innovator is often required to come up with new ideas that can save people time, money, or even lives. If this process is not done right, the innovation could instead lead to danger and disaster.
