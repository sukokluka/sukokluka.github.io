How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.

Creativity is one of the most important aspects of our lives. It is what allows us to express ourselves, to come up with new ideas, and to problem solve. Without creativity, we would be stuck in the same routines day after day.
Creativity is not just for artists or musicians. Everyone has the ability to be creative in their own way. It is important to encourage creativity in children from a young age as it can help them in both their personal and professional lives.

There are many benefits to being creative, including reducing stress, improving mental well-being, and increasing cognitive skills. Creativity can also lead to happiness and a sense of fulfilment.

We all have the potential to be creative. It is something that we should cherish and nurture throughout our lives.
