How do we create communities that work for everyone, regardless of age or background?
In an age where technology has opened up so many opportunities for people to connect and share ideas, it's important that communities remain accessible and inclusive. Ideas 2022 is a project that aims to create communities that work for everyone, regardless of background or age. By creating platforms that allow users to share their thoughts, experiences and ideas anonymously, we can help our younger members feel more connected and welcome in these often-competitive spaces. With this in mind, we're proposing the following: 1) Make it easier for people to find each other by providing a search bar on every community page. This way, anyone with an internet connection can join any discussion or start a new one without having to worry about who they're talking to. 2) Include more than just pictures and links on community pages. Use images, videos and articles to help make your site more engaging for users.
