The nature of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of thought?
Creativity is often considered to be a different form of thought than other forms of thought. This is because creativity involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that are not possible in other forms of thought. It is important to remember, though, that creativity does not require an empty mind or an expansive imagination. In fact, creativity can be developed through any type of activity that allows for thinking outside the box.
