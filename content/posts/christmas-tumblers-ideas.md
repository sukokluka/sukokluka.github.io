what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before. 
Creative art can be therapeutic and can help you express yourself in a way that you might not be able to with words. It can also be a form of relaxation and can help reduce stress. 

Whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to doodle, creative art is for everyone. So get out your paints, pencils, or whatever else you like to use, and start creating!

Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.
