What are the new ideas out there?
There are many new ideas out there, and it can be hard to determine which ones should be introduced into your project. Here are a few tips to help make the decision: 
-Start by asking yourself what you want your project to achieve. If you don’t know yet, consider including goals and target audience in your design.
-Once you have a good idea of what you want, look for potential solutions that could help achieve it. This means identifying problems that need to be solved before anything else can be done, and then thinking of ways to overcome them.
-Finally, consider how much money or time you’ll need to spend on developing the idea before making a decision. If it’s something you think will cost less than both of those things combined, go for it!

Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.
