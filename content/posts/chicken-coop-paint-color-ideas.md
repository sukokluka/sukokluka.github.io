The future of work: What will new technologies mean for the workforce?
New technologies will have a significant impact on the workforce in the not too distant future. They include things like artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and robotics. All of these new technologies present opportunities and challenges for the workforce. 
One important thing to note is that no one technology will be completely dominant. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

For example, AI can help improve efficiency in many industries, such as retail or factory work. However, it can also lead to unemployment if used incorrectly. 

Nanotechnology offers a number of potential solutions for improving efficiency in businesses and workplaces. However, it is still in its early stages of development and has some potential drawbacks as well. For example, nanotechnology-based clothing can't be recycled so it needs to be disposed of properly or stored away for long periods of time.

Invention as a product: How does an invention change the world?
Invention can be defined in a number of ways, but perhaps the most concise way is to say that an invention is a new way of doing something. Inventions have the potential to change how people live, work, and play and can make the world a better place. Some embodiments of this idea are more tangible than others, but all inventions offer potential for change.

Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.
Without big ideas, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things over and over again. It is big ideas that push us to do better and be better. They challenge us to think differently and see the world in new ways.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.

One new idea is to create a government led program that would improve the economy by creating new jobs and making it easier to get credit. This would be a great solution because it would create more wealth and opportunities for people, and it would also reduce the amount of debt people carry.
