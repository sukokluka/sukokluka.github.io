What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? It’s a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. They can’t explain it, but they know it exists. Brainstroming is when a person’s thoughts and ideas are constantly going through their head, like the thoughts of a machine. The problem is, nobody knows why this happens or how to stop it. Some people say that brainstroming is caused by mental exhaustion or stress, while others say it’s the result of some sort of mental enhancement. There isn’t one answer to this question, and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes brainstroming and how to stop it.

Patent and Patenting in Invention
Patenting is a process of making a claim to an invention. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive right to use the invention for the lifetime of the patent, or until someone else patents it. Patents can be granted for any sort of invention, from simple ideas to complex technology. While it can be expensive and time-consuming to get a patent, being able to use a patented invention can give you an edge in competition.
