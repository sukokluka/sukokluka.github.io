The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.
