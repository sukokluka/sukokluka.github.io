How to Come up with Creative Ideas
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but it can be hard to come up with them. There are a few things that help: having an idea, brainstorming, testing, and iteration. 
Here are some tips for coming up with creative ideas:

1. Brainstorm - Brainstorming is key to coming up with new ideas. Start by thinking about the problem you want to solve and how you can improve on what's already out there. What are the possible solutions? 
2. Test - Once you've generated some brainstorm fodder, it's time to test it out. Do something different or innovative with it and see if it works or not. This will help you get a better understanding of how your idea works and what problems might need to be solved in order for it to work well.
