It’s a process that starts with the brainstorming session and continues until the final product is created. It can be used for good or bad outcomes, but creativity has a key advantage; it allows individuals to take risks and think outside the box.

New models for innovation: How can new models for innovation be introduced into current practices to improve outcomes?
Innovation is an ever-evolving process that can improve outcomes by introducing new models and concepts into current practices. Several recent studies have shown that innovation can lead to increased success in terms of productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. However, there are some challenges that need to be overcome before innovation can be successful. One challenge is the fear of change, which can impede the development of new models and concepts. Another challenge is the lack of evidence that a model will work in practice, which can limit the impact of innovation. Finally, there is the need for regulatory support in order to ensure that innovations are brought to market successfully.
