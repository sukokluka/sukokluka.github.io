10 Ideas for a Clean and Lovely Home
1. Start with a cleanliness perspective. Cleaning up your home can be as simple as taking out the trash and putting away your clothes. Or, you could go all out and make a cleaning frenzy by hiring a professional to come out and clean everything from the ceilings to the toilet bowl. The point is, you can start small and gradually increase the frequency of yourcleanup as you become more comfortable with the idea of having a clean home.
2. Make room for organization. One of the most important aspects of having a clean home is making sure there are enough spaces to store your belongings. Whether it’s an attic or one of your downstairs rooms, make sure that you have enough storage space to accommodate all of your belongings. And, if possible, make use of wall-mounted shelves or racks for added organization.

3. Get organized yourself!
