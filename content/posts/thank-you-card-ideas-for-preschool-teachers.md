Research: How to do research to find inventions that can be used.
Invention ideas are a plentiful resource for businesses. The word “invention” can be used to describe anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. However, when it comes to invention research, there are key steps that must be followed in order to find potential products or services that could be used in business. 
One important step in finding inventions is understanding the target market. This means knowing what customers want and how they would use a new product or service. Additionally, it is important to understand the technology behind the product or service in order to create an idea for potential customers. 

Once an idea has been created, it is important to find someone who can test and market the product. This person can help identify any potential consumer problems and potentially create marketing materials that could be helpful in building sales.

Business Strategies for INVENTIONS: What should I do when my invention is accepted?
When your invention is accepted, it can be a huge feeling. It's a sign that you've made something that people will want and use. But there are a few things to keep in mind if your invention is accepted. 
First, make sure you're prepared for the reaction. This could be anything from excitement to skepticism. You'll need to be sure that your idea is unique and worth considering. 
Second, make sure you're doing everything you can to promote your invention. This might include creating buzz around it, making yourself available to answer any questions people have, or writing articles about your invention to help spread the word. 
Finally, be prepared for the financial challenges that come with being an inventor. This might mean having to find investors or selling your idea rights in order to get started on developing it commercially.
