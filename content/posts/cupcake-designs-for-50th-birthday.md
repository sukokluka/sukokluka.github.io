Conclusion: The Benefits of Innovation
Innovation is critical to success in today’s economy. By definition, innovation is the introduction of something new – whether it’s a new product, service, process or business model.

There are many benefits of being an innovative company. Perhaps the most important is that it allows you to stay ahead of the competition. It also makes you more attractive to investors and customers alike. And lastly, it fosters creativity and employee engagement.
