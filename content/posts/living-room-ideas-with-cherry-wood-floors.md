Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is the process of creating something new, using an original idea or design. Patent and trade mark are the two most common types of invention. Patent covers a specific invention, while trade mark covers a particular name or symbol that is used by someone else. There are many different types of inventions, but these are the most common:
Patents: A patent is a document that shows that someone has invented a specific product or service. The patent can cover any kind of product or service, from a simple invention to a very complex one.

Trade marks: Trade marks are similar to patents, but they cover specific names or symbols that are used by someone else instead of just products. Trade marks can be registered with the trade mark office and they can be used on products and services.
