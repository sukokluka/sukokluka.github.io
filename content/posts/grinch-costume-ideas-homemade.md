getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the driving force behind progress. It has led to the creation of technologies that have made our lives easier and more enjoyable. It is a process that involves the generation of new ideas, the development of those ideas into a plan or prototype, and the testing and refinement of the prototype. Inventors are people who are able to see beyond the status quo and imagine something better. They are creative problem-solvers who are always looking for ways to improve upon existing products or create entirely new ones. The invention process can be long and arduous, but the rewards can be great. Those who are successful in inventing something that makes a difference in the world can achieve fame and fortune.
