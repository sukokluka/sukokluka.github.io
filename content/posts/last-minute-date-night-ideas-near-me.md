When to consider a big idea: What are the benefits and drawbacks?
When to consider a big idea is an important question to answer because it can determine the success or failure of your project. There are many factors to consider when deciding when a big idea is the best time to pursue, such as the feasibility of the idea, the potential impact of your ideas, and who will be benefited by your project. Here are four tips on when to consider a big idea:
1. Fidelity – Once you have determined that a big idea is feasible and beneficial, it is important to make sure that it does not conflict with any other projects or commitments you may have. If there are any issues or concerns about whether or not your project would contradict other interests or goals, it may be more difficult to bring your big idea up for consideration. This can lead to shelving the idea altogether or finding another way to make it a reality.

What makes big ideas smart?
When it comes to big ideas, a little bit of thinking and creativity goes a long way. That’s why smarter ideas tend to be ones that are well-executed and scalable. Here are five ways to make your big ideas smarter:
1. Cut out the guesswork: By thinking ahead, you can remove any potential ambiguity or uncertainty. This will help you create a more organized plan and ensure that your idea is well-oiled from the get-go.

2. Carve out a specific target market: You need to identify who your target audience is before you begin working on developing your concept or product. Doing so will help you focus on the right areas of market opportunity and minimize overlap.

The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.
