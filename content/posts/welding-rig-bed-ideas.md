The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

Definition of art: What is the difference between art and creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are new or different from what has been done before. Art, on the other hand, is the creation of art. There are many different definitions of art, but one definition that is often used is "the activity of making something that appeals to the senses." So, while creativity and art can have different meanings, they both involve coming up with new ideas and concepts.

Ideas are what weasel out of hard decisions. They're the alternative that we can't think of or the solution that's too complicated or risky. We're drawn to them because they seem like a way out, but often they're just a way to avoid responsibility. As our world becomes more complex, it's more important than ever to come up with solutions and be relentless in seeking new ideas.
