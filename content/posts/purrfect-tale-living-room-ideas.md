Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

The history of creativity: How has creativity evolved over time?
Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?

Bringing Your Invention to Market: Tips on how to get your invention into the hands of consumers.
Inventing something is only half the battle. The other half is getting it out there in front of consumers. Here are a few tips on how to get your invention into the hands of people who will use it.
1. Do your research. Make sure your invention is novel and has a marketable purpose. There's no point in trying to sell something that no one wants or needs.

2. Develop a prototype. This will help you to not only test your invention, but also show it to potential manufacturers, retailers, or investors.

3. Get a patent. This will give you legal protection and help you to commercialize your invention by licensing it to others.

4. Market your invention.
