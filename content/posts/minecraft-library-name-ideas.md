It can be an effective way to clear out your head and come up with new ideas, but it is also a cause for concern as it can lead towidgetwasting or lost time.

    Ideas can be anything and everything. They can be new ways of looking at an old problem, or new ways to approach an old one. They can be a way to think about something that you've never thought of before, or a way to come up with a solution to a problem that you've never even contemplated. Ideas are the lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we might just as well give up.

Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!
