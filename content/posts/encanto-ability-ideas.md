Mindfulness: What are some ways that we can improve our overall health by implementing mindfulness into our lives?
Mindfulness is a way to improve our overall health by implementing it into our lives. Here are some ways to get started: 
1. Develop a meditation practice: Meditation can help improve your attention span and focus, which can lead to better mental health. Start with 10 minutes per day and grow as you feel comfortable with it. 
2. Take silent time for self-care: taking time for yourself in silence can be helpful in improving your overall wellbeing. Create calm and peaceful surroundings for yourself, and take 5-10 minutes each day to do something that makes you happy, connect with nature, or simply relax. 
3. Connect with others: One of the best things you can do for your mental health is connect with others who care about you.

Types of innovation: What are some types of innovations that businesses commonly use?
Innovation is a process of change that leads to the creation of new products, services, or economy. There are many different types of innovation, but four common types are product innovation, service innovation, market innovation, and business model innovation. 
Product Innovation: Product innovations are changes in the physical form of something that makes it more accessible or useful to consumers.

Service Innovation: Service innovations are changes in the way services are delivered to customers.

This type of innovation is often used for health and fitness applications.
