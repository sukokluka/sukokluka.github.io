Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make things better. From new ways to solve problems to coming up with unique ways of selling products, there are endless creative possibilities out there. Here are a few examples that might be of interest to you: 
1. A new way to use old materials – This is something that can often be creative and innovative. For example, some people create sculptures from old tires or cardboard. This not only uses the materials well but also creates an interesting final product. 
2. Using technology in a new way – Another great way to come up with creative ideas is to use technology in a different way than it usually is used. For example, some people create illuminated signs using lightbulbs implanted in the skin.
