Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!
