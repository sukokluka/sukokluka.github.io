Definition of innovation: How does it differ from traditional methods of production and consumption?
Innovations, according to most definitions, are changes in the way things are done that make them more efficient or effective. However, innovation can also refer to different methods of production and consumption – changes in how we produce and consume goods and services.
Traditional methods of production and consumption have been around for centuries, but they have certain limitations. For example, traditional farming practices require a lot of manual labor to produce goods and services. This means that people who work on traditional farms generally do not have access to high-quality products or services.

On the other hand, new technologies and innovations can allow people to produce goods and services without any human involvement. For example, computer-generated images (CGIs) can be used to create realistic 3D images that are then used by companies to sell products.
