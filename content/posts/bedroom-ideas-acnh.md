Why do you think your ideas are interesting?
Ideas are the fuel that drives creativity. They can be used to come up with new ideas, or to develop an existing idea into something better. There are a few things you need to do in order to make your ideas stand out from the rest:
1. Make sure your ideas are well-conceptualized and engaging. This means having a clear idea of what you want your product or service to do, and making sure it is interesting enough for people to want to try it.

2. Be clear about what your target audience is. If your idea is for a new product, make sure you know who your target market is, and how you plan on reaching them. This will help you focus on the right things when developing your pitch.

3. Use effective marketing techniques to market your idea.
