Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, American scientist Samuel Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail developed the first practical telephone. This invention gave people the ability to communicate with one another without leaving their homes or using traveling telegraphs. The telephone had a number of benefits, including allowing for longer conversations, making it easier to reach people in remote areas, and helping people stay connected at night. The telephone is still an important part of our lives today.

The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.
