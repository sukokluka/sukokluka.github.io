Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.
