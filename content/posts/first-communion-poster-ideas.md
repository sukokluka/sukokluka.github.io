creating a plan: What steps should you take to create a plan for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that you want them to be, but there are a few key steps you should take in order to create a plan for your creative ideas.

Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to start thinking about the deadline that you will be wanting your project done by.
