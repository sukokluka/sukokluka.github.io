Creative ideas: What are the most common ideas that come to people's minds when they think about creativity?
Creativity is something that people think about all the time. Some people think about it in terms of ideas, and some people think about it in terms of making things. Here are some of the most common ideas that come to people's minds when they think about creativity:

2. Idea testing: Sometimes, you need to test out your ideas before you put them into action. This means that you need to see if someone else will be interested in what you have created. 
3. Inventiveness: People often say that creativity is something that comes easy to some people and hard to others. The truth is, it depends on how creative you are.
