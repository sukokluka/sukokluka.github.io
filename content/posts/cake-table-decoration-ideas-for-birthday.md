The four types of creativity: Proactivity, Feeling, Intuition and Ideation.
Creativity is a complex process that can be divided into four types: Proactivity, Feeling, Intuition and Ideation. Proactivity is the act of coming up with ideas or solutions; feeling is the feeling you have when you are creative; intuition is the ability to see things in your future that others cannot; and ideation is the ability to come up with concepts or ideas.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.

4. The finished Product: How does the finished product stack up against other options?
When looking at options for homebuilding, it can be hard to decide which one is the best for you. Whether you're looking to start a home from scratch or just update an existing one, there are a number of different options available. 
One option is to go with a pre-made home. These homes come pre-assembled and can be used in a variety of ways. Some people find them easy to use and others find them more difficult to work with. The final product will likely vary based on the person's preferences. 

Another option is to build your own home. This process can be expensive but it can also be fun and rewarding. There are many different things you can do to help make this process easier such as finding a contractor who specializes in building homes from scratch or finding online resources that can guide you through the process.
