One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful.

Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

How to Use Innovation to Drive Results
Innovations can help businesses achieve success. Here are four ways to leverage innovation to drive results:
1. Use innovation to improve productivity and efficiency. When products are redesigned or new processes are created, employees can be more efficient in their work. This can lead to reduced costs and increased profits.
2. Use innovation to create new markets. When businesses adopt innovative products or services, they may find new customers who would not have otherwise been reached. This can lead to increased sales and a larger profit margin.
3. Use innovation to change the way people live and work. Innovative ideas can help businesses change the way people live for the better, including by increasing efficiency and productivity. This could lead to increased customer loyalty and a higher return on investment (ROI).
