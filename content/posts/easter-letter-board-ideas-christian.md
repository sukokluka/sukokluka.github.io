Defining creativity:
In order to better understand creativity, it is important to first define it. Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. This could involve thinking outside of the box, being imaginative, and having a unique perspective.
Some people are more creative than others, but everyone has the ability to be creative in some way. There are many different ways to express creativity, such as through art, writing, music, and even problem-solving.

Creativity is often thought of as a rare talent, but with a little practice, anyone can improve their creativity. The next time you’re feeling stuck or uninspired, try brainstorming with a friend or taking on a new challenge. You may be surprised at the results!

Creativity is not a rare talent; it is a skill that can be learned and developed. Just as we exercise our bodies to stay physically fit, we need to exercise our minds to stay mentally fit. A creative person is not necessarily someone who paints or writes poetry; creativity is a way of looking at the world with fresh eyes and seeing possibilities where others see only problems.

Ideas: How can we use new ideas toOur lives?
There are so many new ideas out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
-Start with a problem. What do you need more of? More money? More love? Something in between? When you start thinking about things this way, you'll be more likely to come up with ideas for addressing your needs in new and innovative ways. 
-Think outside the box. What if there was a way to use something that's usually used for something else? For example, think about using recycled materials in architecture. You could create unique, sustainable structures with ease! 
-Consider your own needs first. What do you need more of in life than money or love? After all, those two things are obviously necessary for most people. But what do you really need in order to feel fulfilled and happy?

properties of innovation:
Innovation is a process of change that occurs when a new idea, product or service becomes more popular than the existing ones. Innovation can be seen as an exciting opportunity for businesses to create new products and services that improve their customers’ lives. The key to success in innovation is to have a strong vision and plan for the innovation, which can be difficult if the business does not have enough resources or if it does not have the rightpeople on board.
Innovation is often associated with technological progress, but it can also take place in other industries such as architecture and engineering. In architecture, innovation can take place in the design of buildings and infrastructure, as well as in the development of new technologies and marketing strategies.
