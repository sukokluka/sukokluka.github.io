What are some tips for making big ideas a reality?
There are a few things you can do to help turn big ideas into reality. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure your idea is unique and interesting. Don’t just copy other people’s ideas – make sure you have your own approach that will stand out from the rest.

2. Get input from others – get feedback from people who have experience in the industry you’re thinking of entering. This will help you develop your idea further and come up with moreQaeda-friendly ideas.
