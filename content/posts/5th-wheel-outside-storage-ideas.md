Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you don’t know what you want, it’s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.
