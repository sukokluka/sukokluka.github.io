What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. You‚Äôll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, you‚Äôre less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. You‚Äôll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.
