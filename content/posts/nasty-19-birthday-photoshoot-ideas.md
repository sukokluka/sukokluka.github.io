The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

Creative ideas: How to come up with them?
Creative ideas are something that everyone has. Whether you’re a creative writer, artist, or just about anything else, creativity is always on the horizon. Here are 8 tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Start with an idea and work from there. If you have an idea for a book, start by writing the first chapter and seeing what kind of feedback you get from readers. Once you have a feel for what works and doesn’t work in your book, then come up with some tweaks.

2. Get inspired by others. There are endless sources of inspiration when it comes to creative ideas! Look at paintings, sculptures, movies, TV shows – anything that inspires you in some way!

3. Take risks. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, sometimes all it takes is a risk!

Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artist’s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.
