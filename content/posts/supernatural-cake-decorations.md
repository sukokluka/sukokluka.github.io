Some big ideas, like getting rid of tuition, have already been tried and failed. But others, like ending Medicare, are still on the horizon. If we can come up with some good ideas for reforming our government and improving our lives, there is no telling what could be done.

Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesn’t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!

Sometimes these ideas are small, like a new way to make your morning coffee, or a new way to improve your product. Other times, they're much bigger, like the idea for a startup or a new business model. Whatever form they take, big ideas are always worth exploring and trying out.

The three types of creativity: Intuition, Imagination, and Creativity
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and original ideas. It can come from any place in your head, but usually intuition comes first. Intuition is what gets you started on your creative journey. Imagination is next, and it helps you to bring your ideas to life. Lastly, creativity comes from the ability to let go of control and just let things flow.
