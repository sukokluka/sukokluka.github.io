What are some good ideas?
There are many great ideas floating around out there. Whether it's something new and innovative or just something that everyone can agree on, here are a few to get you started: 
1. Start a blog: This is a great way to stay up-to-date with what's happening in the world and to share your own thoughts and observations with the world. Not only can this be used as an outlet for your creative juices, but it can also be a great place for you to connect with others who may have similar interests. 
2. Create an online course: This could be anything from learning about a specific topic to getting up-to-date on current events. Just make sure that the content is of high quality so that people will stick around for a while.

How do inventors go about coming up with new inventions?
Invention ideas are one of the most important aspects of any inventor's toolkit. They can be used to solve problems or make new products. However, coming up with new inventions can be difficult. There are many ways to come up with new inventions, but the most important thing is to think of a solution that you can see happening in the future.
One way to come up with new inventions is to focus on a problem that you know people need and want solved. You can also look at industries that are in your field and see what products or services they currently use or would like to use in the future. Another way to come up with new inventions is by thinking outside the box. You can develop a product idea that isn't currently being used or marketed. This will give you an idea for how you could make your product stand out from the competition.
