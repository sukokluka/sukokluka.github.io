Idea 3: How do we use ideas?
Ideas can be put to use in many ways, but one of the most common is turning them into action plans. Whether you're looking to start a business, improve your fitness routine, or just think of new ways to spend your free time, ideas are a great way to get started. Here are three simple tips on how to use ideas to create ACTION plans:
1. Look at what other people have done and come up with ideas for things that you could do yourself too.
2. Take some time for yourself and come up with 10-15 different ideas for things you could do in your spare time. Once you've narrowed it down, take a look at Action Items and see what devices or activities work best for each one.
