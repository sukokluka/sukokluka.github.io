Causes and Solutions: How can we improve our overall health by understanding why some things are causing us problems, and what can be done to fix them?
Every day, we make decisions that have an impact on our health and well-being. Unfortunately, not everyone understands why some things are causing them problems, and so they don't take the necessary steps to fix them. This lack of understanding can lead to a number of issues, including chronic pain, mental health issues, and even physical illness. To improve overall health, we need to understand the root causes of these problems and take the necessary steps to fix them. Here are five key ideas to help you do just that: 
1) Understand your triggers: every time you experience an unpleasant or stressful event (like getting a new job), your body releases chemicals like glutamate from the brains cells in response. These chemicals can cause pain signals to be sent directly to your brain stem.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.
