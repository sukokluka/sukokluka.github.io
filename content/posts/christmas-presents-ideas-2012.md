What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there. This technology could be used for training new employees or salespeople, or even for entertainment purposes.

3. Another trend we can expect to see in 2022 is the growth of self-driving cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and efficiency features.

Trends in computing: What new ways will information and communication technologies change the way we use and understand our world?
Technology has always had a huge impact on our lives. The development of information and communication technologies has led to a whole new level of interactivity and understanding between people and the world around them. Some of the most significant changes that will occur in this area are as follows:
1) New ways of communicating: Communication is now an integral part of everyday life, and it has changed immensely in the past few decades. Gone are the days where people communicated through written documents or talking with friends over weekly phone calls. These days, we communicate through digital platforms such as social media, text messages, and even emails. This allows us to be more connected to each other and share ideas and experiences at any time, anywhere.

2) A more globalized world: The globalization of the world has led to a more interconnected world economy.
