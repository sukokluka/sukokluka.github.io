Creative problem solving: How can you come up with creative solutions?
Creative problem solving has always been a popular method of problem solving. However, as the world becomes more complex and technological, creative solutions are needed more often than ever. Here are 5 tips to help you come up with creative solutions:
1. Take a step back and ask yourself what you want your solution to be. Once you have this answer, start thinking about how you can best achieve it. For example, if you’re trying to create a custom PCB design, think about what problems you could solve with different designs.

2. Look at other people’s work and see how they have tackled similar problems. This will give you ideas for how to approach your own project and also help you find commonalities between different projects.

3. Talk to others in your industry and see what challenges they face when it comes to creating innovative solutions.
