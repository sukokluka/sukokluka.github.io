Big ideas are the foundation of any successful organization. By definition, big ideas are new and innovative. They can be used to create new products, services, or programs. However, before any big idea may be implemented, it must be tested and proven in a test market. Big ideas can also be formulas for success, but often times they need to be adapted to fit the specific company and its culture.
