Examples of creative thinking in business
Creativity is a critical component of business. In fact, creativity is seen as one of the most important skills for businesses to possess. There are a number of ways businesses can use creativity in their operations and this column will explore an example from a logistics company. 
A logistics company is responsible for moving goods around the country. They need to come up with ideas for avoiding congestion and getting the products to their customers on time. One way they do this is by coming up with new ways to package products and get them to customers faster.

One idea they came up with was using 3D printing technology to create custom boxes for each product. This would allow them to print boxes that would be specific to the product and meet the customer's needs exactly.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

The impact of creativity on society: What are the benefits of creativity?
Creativity is often seen as a good thing, as it can help us come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. However, some people contend that creativity can actually have negative effects on society. It can lead to less innovation, creativity being used more for the purposes of entertainment instead of real-world solutions, and even social unrest. But how do we determine whether or not creativity has positive or negative effects on society? And should we be striving for more creative output?
