Creative expression: How can creativity be used to your advantage?
Creativity is an important tool for any business. It can be used to create unique products or services, or to come up with new ideas for marketing campaigns. However, creativity can also be used in a negative way. For example, some businesses use creativity to make their products look bad instead of selling them at a high price. Other businesses use creativity to come up with innovative ways to compete with other companies. However, all of these examples are important aspects of business and should not be taken lightly.
