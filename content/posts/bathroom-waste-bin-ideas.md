Repainting a Room: Tips and tricks for painting a room successfully.
If you’re looking to spruce up your living room or bedroom, there are a few easy tricks to help out. Here are a few tips to repaint your room successfully:
1) Start with the basics: Paint the walls first and then the ceiling. This will give your painting project a more unified feel.

2) Use a light color for each area of the room: If you want your walls to be in one color, use that color in all of your walls. If you want your ceilings and floors to be different colors, start with one color and add other shades as needed.

3) Don’t forget about trim: Wipe down any debris that may have built up on the wallpapers or flooring, and try to get rid of any excess paint.

History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!
