Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.
Without big ideas, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things over and over again. It is big ideas that push us to do better and be better. They challenge us to think differently and see the world in new ways.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.
