Causes and Effects of Innovation: Why do people innovate?
Innovation is a natural process that is necessary for businesses to succeed. It allows companies to come up with new ideas and products that can compete in the market. Innovation also benefits society as a whole by creating new technologies and innovations that make life easier for people. There are many reasons why innovation happens, but one of the most important reasons is for the business benefit. In order for a company to be successful, it needs to have innovative products and services that can appeal to customers. However, there are also negative effects of innovation that can impact businesses and society as a whole. There are several reasons why this might happen, but one of the most common is when businesses try to change the status quo by introducing new products or services that are not popular yet. In doing so, they risk disrupting the established order in their industry or putting their competitors at a disadvantage.
