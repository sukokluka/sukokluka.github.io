The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics.

For example, innovations in healthcare could lead to better treatments for patients and lessened costs; or innovations in transportation could make it easier for people to reach their destinations safely and efficiently.
