The definition of an invention: What is it?
Inventions are creations that make things work better or easier than they would without them. They can be physical objects like a car or a computer, or intellectual property like a patent or trade secret. There are many different types of inventions, and the definition of an invention can vary depending on what you're looking for. For example, some people might define an invention as a new product, while others might focus on making something easier or more efficient. This concept is also important to understand when it comes to patenting an invention - not all inventions need to be patented in order for them to be considered an invention.

Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing. Here are three tips on how to make your big idea a reality: 1) think long and hard about what you want your business to achieve, 2) do your research before starting your business, and 3) stay focused on what you want your business to be and not on what others are expecting it to be.
