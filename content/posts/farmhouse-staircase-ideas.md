What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.

Air Quality Issues in Your Home: Some tips for improving air quality in your home.
If you're like most people, you probably take air quality seriously when it comes to your home. You might think about greening your home, getting a air purifier, or even simply getting a better air quality index rating. However, there are other ways to improve air quality in your home as well – some of which are easy and can be done without too much effort. Here are a few tips for improving air quality in your home: 
1) Make sure your windows are properly sealed. Poorly sealed windows allow harmful particles from the outside into the house and can cause respiratory problems.

2) Get a good air purifier. Air purifiers can help clean the air around you and reduce the amount of unhealthy ozone gas that is created by car engines and other sources.

3) Use proper ventilation!
