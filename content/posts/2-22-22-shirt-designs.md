Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to reach your target audience or developing a new marketing strategy, creativity is always key to success. Here are some final thoughts on creative ideas: 
1. Make sure your ideas are relevant to your target audience. If you don’t know what your target audience is, you won’t be able to come up with ideas that will capture their attention. 
2. Be sure to think outside the box. Sometimes the best way to get people’s attention is to do something they haven’t seen before. Be sure not only to come up with original ideas, but also find ways to market them successfully.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
