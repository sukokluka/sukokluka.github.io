The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.

What are the different ways to come up with ideas?
Let's face it, come up with ideas can be a challenge. But there are different ways to approach coming up with them. Here are three ways: 
1. Brainstorm with others: When you're stuck, brainstorm with other people to get their help. They might have a better idea than you do, and they might be more willing to share what they know.

2. Take a walk: Take a walk around your neighborhood or city to get new ideas for businesses or products. This can also lead you to places where you haven't thought of before.

3. Find an online course: If all else fails, take an online course on creativity in business or product design. This can help you learn how to come up with ideas from scratch and see how different techniques work in the real world.
