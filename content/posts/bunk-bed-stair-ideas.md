Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.
