Marketability of inventions: How can you make your inventions stand out from the competition?
Invention ideas can be everything from a new product to a better way to do something. But in order to make your inventions stand out and be more marketable, it's important to have good ideas that are easy to understand and understand why people would want them. Here are five tips on how to make your inventions stand out:
1. Be clear and concise: Are you trying to impress with your invention or just get people interested? When you're writing your patent application, try to be as clear and concise as possible about what your invention is, what it does, and why people would want it.

2. Use images: Images can help show people what your invention is like and how it can benefit their lives. Use pictures of products or services that people already use or know about. This will help viewers see how the invention could improve their life in some way.

Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?
