The different types of brainstroming:
There are three main types of brainstroming: ideational, non-ideational, and scientific. Ideational brainstroming is the most common type of brainstroming. It occurs when an individual has an idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. Non-ideational brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea but can't seem to put it into words. Scientific brainstroming is when an individual has a good idea and can't seem to get it out of their head. It usually happens when an individual is working on a project and they have no other ideas.
