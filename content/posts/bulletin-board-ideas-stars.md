How to overcome creative blocks:
When it comes to being creative, sometimes the hardest part is getting started. If you're feeling stuck, here are a few tips to help you overcome those creative blocks and get those ideas flowing again.
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, all you need is a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work to clear your head. This can help refresh your mind and give you a new perspective on how to approach your project.

2. Talk to others: When you're feeling stuck, talking to other creatives can give you some great ideas. Ask them how they overcame their own creative blocks, what resources they use and what techniques work best for them. Hearing from others can jumpstart your own creativity.
