The Future of Invention: We are in a golden age of invention and creativity.
Invention and creativity are at an all-time high. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to old problems. It’s what has made us civilization as we know it. And it’s what will make us the best for the future.
The recent surge in innovation has been fueled by three main factors: technology, energy and human creativity. With technology getting ever better, more people are able to access new knowledge and ideas faster than ever before. This has led to a rise in innovation and creativity, which is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

On the other hand, energy is becoming increasingly scarce, making it even harder for companies to come up with new ideas. But this isn’t stopping companies from trying – there are now dozens of startups that are using solar energy to create new products and services.

Top 5 Ideas to Start a Business: What are they?
1. Get a business idea. A business idea can come from anything that you think could be profitable or interesting. It doesn't have to be something you're already familiar with, either. Go online and search for phrases like "business ideas for young entrepreneurs" or "business ideas for people with disabilities."
2. Start a business with friends or family members. This is one of the best ways to get started because it's low-cost and easy. Ask your parents, your siblings, or your friends if they know anyone who might be interested in starting their own business. You can also start a business through a website or an online course.

3. Use the internet to find clients and clients' families.
