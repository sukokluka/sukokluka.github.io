Creative problem-solving:
Creative problem-solving is a key part of any creative personâ€™s toolbox. By solving problems, you can produce high-quality work. Here are a few tips to help you explore and solve creative problems:
1) Do your research before you start anything. When starting something new, itâ€™s helpful to know what others have done and how theyâ€™ve solved similar problems. This will give you an idea of how to approach the problem and what steps should be taken next.

2) Take your time. Donâ€™t try to do too much at once. If you hurry, you might not get the results that you want or need. Time allows for moreassing thought and creates a better atmosphere for creativity.

3) Be patient. Donâ€™t expect everything to go as planned the first time around.
