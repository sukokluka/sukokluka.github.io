The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the key to success in any field. By exploring and applying big ideas, you can realize your full potential and achieve great things. Here are a few tips on how to create big ideas that will help you throughout your career:
1. Make sure your ideas are realistic – don’t overthink things or hype them up too much. If your idea is unrealistic, it won’t be taken seriously and you’ll end up wasting time and energy on something that won’t pan out.

2. Be patient – take your time in developing your big idea and make sure it isn’t just a one-time project. As you develop it, make sure to keep track of the results so that you can measure how well it was received by the audience.

In art, this deviation can come from simply rearranging or adapting pieces of material, to using new voices or ideas to create something new and/or different. Whether it’s a creative idea for a painting or a piece of music, deviations from the norm are what make art creative.
