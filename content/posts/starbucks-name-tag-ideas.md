The different types of big ideas
Big ideas are the foundation of any successful business. They can be used to create new products, services, or strategies. But which big ideas are most important to your business? Here are four types that will help you focus on what's important to you: 
1. Product: A big idea is a unique idea that can be turned into a product. This could be a new product, service, or strategy. 
2. Service: A big idea is a unique solution that can be offered as a service. This could include new methods of selling or providing services, or existing services being improved in a new way. 
3. Strategy: A big idea is an outline of how your business should go forward, with specific goals in mind. This could include creating new markets, expanding your customer base, or expanding your competitive edge.
