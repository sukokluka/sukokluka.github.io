Causes and Effects of Innovation: Why do people innovate?
Innovation is a natural process that is necessary for businesses to succeed. It allows companies to come up with new ideas and products that can compete in the market. Innovation also benefits society as a whole by creating new technologies and innovations that make life easier for people. There are many reasons why innovation happens, but one of the most important reasons is for the business benefit. In order for a company to be successful, it needs to have innovative products and services that can appeal to customers.

The history of creativity: How has creativity evolved over time?
Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?

As our world becomes more complex, it's more important than ever to come up with solutions and be relentless in seeking new ideas.

getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.
