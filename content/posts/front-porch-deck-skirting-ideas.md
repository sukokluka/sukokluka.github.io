What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful way to get started on any project. They can help you see a solution to a problem or come up with new ideas for something. There are many benefits to having ideas, including getting inspired and finding new ways to approach your work. Here are five of the most common: 
1. Ideas can help you think outside the box. When you have new ideas, you can start to see other possibilities for what could be done. This can free up your mind and allow you to come up with better solutions than you would have thought possible. 

2. Ideas can help you get organized. Having lots of different ideas makes it easier to organize them all into a one big idea category. This is especially helpful if your idea is complex or difficult to execute without assistance. 

3. Ideas can help you find solutions to problems.

Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

Creativity, communication, commitment, and control are the four Cs of creativity. Creative people are able to share their ideas and concepts with others in a way that is effective and connects with them.
