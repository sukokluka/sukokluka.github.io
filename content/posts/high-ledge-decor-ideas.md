Solutions: How to fix a problem with a tool or project?

1. Check the tool's documentation before using it. Many tools come with extensive user manuals that can answer any questions you have about them. Make sure to read these before starting the project.

2. Be familiar with the tool's features and limitations. most tools come with comprehensive detailed documentation, but not all of them do justice to their features and limitations. Be patient and test the tool until you see how it behaves in practice. This will help you determine whether the tool is worth your time and money.
