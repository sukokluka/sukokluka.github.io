Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better. This is what makes innovation so important – it allows companies to constantly improve their products and services while also taking advantage of new opportunities.
But the main difference between innovation and other types of innovation is that innovation is not always about money.
