Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had not been considered before. Invention has been around for centuries, and it began with the Greeks.
