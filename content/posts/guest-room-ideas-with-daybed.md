Conclusion: Are there any drawbacks to having ideas? How can you overcome them?
Ideas are a great way to think about new ideas and come up with new ways to do things. However, there are some drawbacks that can occur when having ideas. The first drawback is that it can be difficult to come up with all of the details needed for an idea to take off. This can lead to a lack of confidence in your idea and a less likely chance of seeing it through to the end. Another drawback is that ideas can be very time-consuming and require a lot of effort from you and others involved in the project. This can lead to feeling overworked or undervalued when it comes time for the idea to actually be implemented.

Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
