Aims and objectives of creativity: What are they, and how do they differ from those of other art forms?
Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas and concepts that are unrelated to what is currently on the surface. It can be found in all forms of art, but creativity in particular revolves around the idea of composition orlayout. In creative art, the aim is to create something that is unique and different from anything else in the world. Other forms of art may have specific objectives such as teaching or promoting a message, but creativity has no set boundaries.

How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.

Conclusion: Some tips for using creative ideas.
Creative ideas are a great way to improve your productivity, creativity, and thought processes. Here are some tips to get started:

2. Take a break often: If you’re working on something that you’re really passionate about, it can be hard to let go of it. So take a few minutes away from the project to relax and clear your head. 
3. Get feedback: You won’t be able to create great work if you don’t have any support from others. Get in touch with friends, family, and colleagues for feedback so that you can start formulating ideas more effectively.
