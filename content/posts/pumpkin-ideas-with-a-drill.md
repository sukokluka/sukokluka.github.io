The power of creativity: how does creativity work?
Creativity is an intricate and often mysterious process that goes beyond the simple act of creating. It involves a deep understanding of the creative process, as well as the individual’s own personality and environment. This understanding can be gained through years of practice or by simply thinking about creativity in new ways.
There are many theories about creativity, but one that has been dominant for many years is the Creative Art Theory. This theory suggests that creativity comes from a combination of two things: the artist’s own ideas and the environment they are working in. The artist creates what they see and hear in their surroundings, then uses this information to create their own masterpiece. The environment also plays a role in creativity, by providing ideas and inspiration to the artist. When these two elements combine, it leads to a unique piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone who visits it.

Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.
