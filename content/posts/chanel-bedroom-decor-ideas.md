Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Summarize your main points.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.

A good conclusion can be the difference between an essay that’s just okay and one that really stands out. So don’t underestimate the importance of writing a great one!

The impact of globalization on business: What will be the largest impacts from globalization in 2022?
When it comes to business, globalization is quickly on the rise. With more people living in cities and countries near by, businesses have to adapt or go out of business. In 2022, there are many big global changes that will have an impact on businesses and individuals. Here are some of the biggest potential impacts: 
1) The rise in electronic commerce will lead to increased demand for goods and services from all over the world. This increase in demand can be difficult to meet, as manufacturers must compress production times and find new ways to reach consumers. 
2) Rising labor costs will hike prices for goods and services, even for low-cost countries. This increase in costs can force companies to reduce their output or even close their doors altogether. 
3) A crackdown on tax evasion by multinational corporations could lead to increased taxes on these companies’ profits worldwide.

If they haven t, they may not have been able to improve their ideas or come up with new ways to approach problems. The second factor is the intensity of the creative process itself. If it s gentle, nurturing, and doesn t require any hard work or effort on the part of the creator, then they may be more likely to maintain their creative Passions for life.
