How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.
