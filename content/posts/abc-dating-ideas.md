Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.

Business models: How to make an invention successful?
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen, but the ones that work can be very profitable. Here are four tips on how to make your invention successful:
1. Choose the right business model: Any invention should have a specific business model in mind before you can begin developing it. Make sure that your business is able to pay off its investment, generate income, and attract customers.

2. Get market saturation: Once your invention has reached a certain level of popularity, it will be more difficult to switch it to another business model. To get market saturation, make sure that your product or service is well-received by a wide range of people. This can include both potential customers and competitors.
