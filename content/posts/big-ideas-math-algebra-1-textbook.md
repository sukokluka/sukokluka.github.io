Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.
