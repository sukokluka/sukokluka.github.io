Invention is the act of making something new. It can be a new product, a new process, or a new way of doing something. Inventors are people who have a creative mind and come up with new ideas. This can be done by improving upon an existing invention or coming up with something completely new. The process of invention usually involves many steps, such as generating ideas, developing a prototype, testing, and marketing the invention.

What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.

Big ideas are those that could have a significant impact on the world. They can be things that people have never thought of, or ideas that are relatively new and unexplored. Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.
