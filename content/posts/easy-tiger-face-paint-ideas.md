The dangers of not being creative: What can go wrong if you don't focus on your potential?
Creativity is one of the most important qualities you can have in your life. It allows you to see new possibilities and come up with ideas that no one else could have thought of. However, if you don't focus on your potential, you can easily go wrong. Here are a few examples:

2) You might not be able to come up with ideas that are unique or interesting because nobody has ever done them before. 
3) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because you're too timid or scared to try something new. 
4) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because your mind is too concentrated on detail instead of taking a broader view.
