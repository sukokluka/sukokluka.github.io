Origins of creativity: The human brain's ability to come up with new ideas.
Creativity has a long and mysterious history. Scientists have been trying to understand its origins for decades, but there is still much to learn about how creativity evolved. There are several theories about how creativity comes about, but one of the most popular is the “genetic lottery” theory. This theory posits that creativity emerges from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Other theories focus on the role of the hippocampus, which is tucked deep inside the brainstem. The hippocampus helps us remember new ideas and can be important in helping us come up with new solutions to problems. While there is still much to learn about how creativity works, these theories offer some interesting insights into its origins.

What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood.
