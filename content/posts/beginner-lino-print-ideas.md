The importance of creativity in daily life: What are the benefits?
Creativity is key to a successful day-to-day life. It can help you come up with new ideas, find solutions to problems, and be more creative in your work. In fact, creativity is so important that it has been shown to have powerful health benefits. Here are five of the most compelling reasons why creativity matters: 
1. You can be more creative when you’re fresh and relaxed. When you’re focused and working under pressure, your mind tends to stay busiest rather than get filled with new ideas. This can lead to stagnation and a lack of progressivism in your work, which can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. 

2. Creativity can help you make better decisions.
