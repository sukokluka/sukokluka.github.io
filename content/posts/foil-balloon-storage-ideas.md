What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

Conclusion: The benefits of brainstroming are vast and varied, and it can have a profound impact on people’s lives.
Brainstroming is a condition in which one’s thoughts and feelings are focused on a single topic. This can be beneficial for the individual, as it allows them to focus on their problem and come up with a solution. However, brainstroming can also have negative effects, depending on the person’s personality and mindset. If someone is brainstroming all the time, they may feel overwhelmed and alone. In addition, they may start to doubt themselves and their abilities.
