The benefits of big thinking
If you want to change the world, you have to start by thinking big. That’s the premise behind big thinking: the belief that we can solve problems and create opportunities by coming up with large-scale solutions.
It’s an approach that has yielded some of the most important breakthroughs in history, from the discovery of vaccines to the development of nuclear power. And it’s an approach that is increasingly necessary in a world that is becoming more complex and interconnected.

Big thinking is about more than just coming up with big ideas. It’s also about having the courage to act on those ideas, even when they seem impossible. After all, it was a big thinker who said, “The impossible just takes a little longer.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
