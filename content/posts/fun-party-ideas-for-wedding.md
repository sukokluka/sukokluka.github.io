How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.

Air Quality Issues in Your Home: Some tips for improving air quality in your home.
If you're like most people, you probably take air quality seriously when it comes to your home. You might think about greening your home, getting a air purifier, or even simply getting a better air quality index rating. However, there are other ways to improve air quality in your home as well – some of which are easy and can be done without too much effort. Here are a few tips for improving air quality in your home: 
1) Make sure your windows are properly sealed. Poorly sealed windows allow harmful particles from the outside into the house and can cause respiratory problems.

2) Get a good air purifier. Air purifiers can help clean the air around you and reduce the amount of unhealthy ozone gas that is created by car engines and other sources.

3) Use proper ventilation!
