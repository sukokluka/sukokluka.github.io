What are some of the most common invention ideas?
Inventions have helped humanity in many ways, from small gadgets to major advances in technology. Here are a few of the most common invention ideas:
1. Digital watches: In 1844, Swiss scientist Leonhard Euler invented the wristwatch, which allowed people to track their time and date more easily.
2. Air conditioning: In cooling off after a hot day, people would often open windows to air out their homes and families. In 1927, American engineer Charles Lindbergh patented an air conditioner that could be controlled by Pitot tubes to keep rooms cool on hot days.

The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea. This idea is typically something that has been on someone’s mind for a while, but they have never had a good way to bring it to fruition. The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!
