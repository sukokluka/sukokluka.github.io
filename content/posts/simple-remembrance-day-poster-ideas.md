The origins of many inventions can be traced back to the dawn of human civilization. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Eratosthenes in 384 BC. Other inventions that have had a lasting impact include the printing press and television.

The importance of creativity in daily life: What are the benefits?
Creativity is key to a successful day-to-day life. It can help you come up with new ideas, find solutions to problems, and be more creative in your work. In fact, creativity is so important that it has been shown to have powerful health benefits. Here are five of the most compelling reasons why creativity matters: 
1. You can be more creative when you’re fresh and relaxed. When you’re focused and working under pressure, your mind tends to stay busiest rather than get filled with new ideas. This can lead to stagnation and a lack of progressivism in your work, which can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. 

2. Creativity can help you make better decisions.

How does innovation help businesses succeed?
Businesses that are able to innovate and embrace change are able to grow their businesses faster and achieve success. Innovation can be done in a number of ways, but some of the most common methods include:
1. Bringing in new ideas – whether it’s from outside of the company or from within itself. This can help businesses see new possibilities and come up with innovative ways to improve their products or services.

2. Applying cutting-edge technology – again, whether it’s from outside of the company or from within themselves. With technology becoming more and more complex every day, innovation is key in being able to keep up with the changing trends.

3. Updating old methods – again, this could come from outside of the company or inside themselves if they’re using outdated processes or tools.
