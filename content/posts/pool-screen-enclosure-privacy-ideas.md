What are big ideas?
There are many big ideas in the world, but what makes a good idea? This question is difficult to answer, as there is no one right answer. However, some tips on how to make an idea into a successful business venture can help. 1) Start with a small goal: What are your main goals for the business? Once you have a solid goal, it is easier to develop a plan and execute on it. 2) Be realistic: Don’t expect your business to be anything great right away. First, focus on making money and expanding your reach. 3) Keep things simple: When you start developing your idea, don’t overcomplicate things too much. 4) Be patient: Take your time in developing your business idea and don’t rush things.

How to be creative: Tips and tricks.
1. Be open to new and different ideas. One way to become more creative is to expose yourself to new and different ideas. This can be done by reading, attending lectures or workshops, and talking with people who think differently than you do.
