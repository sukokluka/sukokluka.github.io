What are the best ways to have ideas?
Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups can't achieve their goals and achieve success. Here are 8 ways to have more ideas:
1. Take a walk around your neighbourhood. This will help you get a mental picture of what your business could look like and how it could Benefit the neighbourhood.
2. Get involved in community activities. Volunteering your time and energy to organisations that you believe in is a great way to get ideas for your business from people who already care about the world you're trying to build for them. 
3. Do some brainstorming with friends or family members. These conversations can help you come up with various concepts for your business, which can then be turned into realisations through brainstorming with others.
