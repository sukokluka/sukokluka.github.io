Creativity is not only about being different; it’s about being better. It’s about problem-solving, and thinking outside the box. And it’s a skill that can be learned. Here are three benefits of being more creative:
1. You’ll be better at problem-solving.

When you have to come up with an original solution to a problem, you need to be able to think creatively. This means looking at the problem from different angles, and considering unconventional solutions.

2. You’ll be more successful in your career.

More and more employers are valuing creativity in the workplace. They know that employees who can think creatively are more likely to come up with new ideas, solve problems and drive innovation.
