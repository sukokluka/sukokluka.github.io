The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.

The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Phonograph Company president Edward Emmons and his brother George. They created a machine that could play sound files on a screen.

The modern computer was invented in 1947 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Bell Labs in New York City. It uses vacuum tubes to process information instead of magic numbers and letters like earlier computers did.

Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.
