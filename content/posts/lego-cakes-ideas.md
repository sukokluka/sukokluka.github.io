Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but there’s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, it’s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.

How does the creative process work? How does an artist come up with ideas for their artwork? What are some common techniques used in the creative process?
Creative artists use a variety of creative techniques in order to come up with new and original ideas for their artwork. Some common techniques used by creative artists are brainstorming, problem solving, and imagination. In order to get started in the creative process, artists often need some inspiration. This can come from reading articles, watching videos, or listening to music. Once they have some inspiration, the artist can start to work on creating their own ideas. Sometimes this involves coming up with different ways to depict a certain subject or idea. Once the artist has a good idea for their artwork, they need to put it into practice in order to make it as good as they can. Sometimes working on an artwork takes many different iterations before it is finally finished.

Patenting an invention: What is the process?
Patenting an invention can be a complex process, but there are key steps that are typically followed. Inventors typically create a patent application, which is then submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The USPTO will review the application and decide whether to issue a patent or not. If the USPTO decides to issue a patent, the inventor must then file a full U.S. Patent Act lawsuit against someone who has already registered their trade mark or copyrighted their invention.
