3. Review what you did to solve the problem
There are a few things that you can do in order to solve a problem. One of the most common techniques is brainstorming, which is when you come up with ideas for solving a problem without actually knowing how to fix it. Brainstroming is another way of solving problems, and it involves taking some specific ideas and turning them into a plan. This way, you can start thinking about ways to make your plan work and then take action towards achieving your goals.

Marketability of inventions: How can you make your inventions stand out from the competition?
Invention ideas can be everything from a new product to a better way to do something. But in order to make your inventions stand out and be more marketable, it's important to have good ideas that are easy to understand and understand why people would want them. Here are five tips on how to make your inventions stand out:
1. Be clear and concise: Are you trying to impress with your invention or just get people interested? When you're writing your patent application, try to be as clear and concise as possible about what your invention is, what it does, and why people would want it.

2. Use images: Images can help show people what your invention is like and how it can benefit their lives. Use pictures of products or services that people already use or know about. This will help viewers see how the invention could improve their life in some way.

The impact of globalization on business: What will be the largest impacts from globalization in 2022?
When it comes to business, globalization is quickly on the rise. With more people living in cities and countries near by, businesses have to adapt or go out of business. In 2022, there are many big global changes that will have an impact on businesses and individuals. Here are some of the biggest potential impacts: 
1) The rise in electronic commerce will lead to increased demand for goods and services from all over the world. This increase in demand can be difficult to meet, as manufacturers must compress production times and find new ways to reach consumers. 
2) Rising labor costs will hike prices for goods and services, even for low-cost countries. This increase in costs can force companies to reduce their output or even close their doors altogether. 
3) A crackdown on tax evasion by multinational corporations could lead to increased taxes on these companiesâ€™ profits worldwide.

The brainstroming phenomenon is a reportedly unique event that happens when the brain is stimulated by a noise or environment. This can cause the brain to work harder and produce more results than usual. There are many theories about how this happens, but no one knows for sure what Causes it. Some believe that the noise or environment can help to increase blood flow to the cortex, leading to a stronger thought process.
