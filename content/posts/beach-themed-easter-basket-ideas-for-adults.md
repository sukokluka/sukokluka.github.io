Conclusion: Some tips for coming up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ideas for products or services. Here are a few tips to help you come up with creative ideas:
1. Brainstorm with others: When brainstorming, it is helpful to take turns sharing your ideas. This will allow you to gain feedback and improve on what you’re thinking.

2. Use analogies and metaphors: Analogies and metaphors are powerful tools for coming up with new ideas. For example, if you’re brainstorming product concepts, you might compare a toy to a Ferrari or a computer game to the cockpit of an airplane.

3. Take advantage of opportunity: Opportunity is the key to creativity, and taking advantage of it will help you come up with more creative solutions than you would have otherwise thought possible.

Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information. It has been used in various ways such as for gaming, speech recognition, and more. 
One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence is its ability to learn quickly and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This makes it ideal for tasks such asAutonomous Patrols or airport security. Another advantage is its ability to improve our understanding of the world around us. For example, if you were looking for a restaurant, AI could help you find one that was close by or give you recommendations based on your interests.
