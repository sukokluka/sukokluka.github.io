Brainstorming: techniques for generating ideas
Generating ideas can be a daunting task, whether you’re starting a new project or looking for ways to improve an existing one. But with a little creativity and some structure, the process can be much less intimidating.
Here are a few brainstorming techniques that can help you generate ideas:

1. Brainstorming with someone else. Collaborating with someone else can help stimulate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have thought of on your own.

2. Use prompts. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas on your own, prompts can be a helpful way to get the creative juices flowing. You can use prompts from books, online resources, or even make up your own.

3. Take a walk. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from thinking about it altogether.

The benefits of DIY projects: How do they help you?
Are you looking for ways to make your life easier? There are many DIY projects that can help you do just that. Whether you're looking to make a new kitchen appliance, refinish an old one, or just change up your decor, there are many possibilities. Here are four tips on how to start making your own DIY projects: 1. Decide what you want to achieve by doing the project. If you're trying to fix something broken, it might be easier to buy the parts and tools needed instead of building it yourself. When creating a project, think about what will save time and help you reach your goals. For example, if you're refinishing an old piece of furniture, think about which materials will take the least amount of time and effort to clean and remove. 2. research the subject matter before starting the project.
