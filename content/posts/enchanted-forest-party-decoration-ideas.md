How can it be implemented?

1. Start by thinking about what you want your product or service to do. What needs will it address? What are the benefits of using your product or service? These questions will help you to create a vision for your business and come up with a plan of how to make that happen. 
2. Once you have a vision, it's time to start planning how to achieve it. This can be done in many different ways, but one important step is creating an outline of how your business will operate and what products or services will be offered. This will help you develop marketing plans and identify where money should go in order to bring your vision to life.
