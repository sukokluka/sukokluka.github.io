The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:
1. Category: What is your idea in question? This will determine its feasibility and whether it can be turned into a successful product or service.
2. Concept: How well does your idea align with the category you have chosen? If it's a new take on an old product, for example, then you'll need to come up with a concept that makes sense within the category being explored. And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?

What are some common mistakes people make when trying tobrainstrom?
When trying tobrainstrom, some common mistakes people make include not learning from their mistakes, thinking they know what they are doing, and underestimating the power of positive thinking. To help you avoid making these mistakes, here are a few tips: 1. First and foremost, be honest with yourself – ask yourself what specifically made you do something wrong the last time you tried brainstroming. If you can't answer this question, it's probably best not to try it again. Knowing your weaknesses will help you focus on attacking them rather than letting them sit there stagnant. 2. Next, work on your practice skills – if you're someone who struggles with problem-solving or strategy development, make sure to practice these skills regularly. This way, when you finally get started with brainstroming, you'll be well-prepared and comfortable starting out.
