Underlying drivers of innovation: The need for new information, technology, or business models
Innovation is what makes businesses and societies successful. It allows for new products, services, or ideas to be developed and offered to the public. However, without innovation, businesses can quickly lose their competitive edge and society can become more stagnant. There are several underlying drivers of innovation that must be considered if we want to see continued success for our industries and societies.
New information technology is vital for businesses in order to increase efficiency and innovate faster. Technologies like chatbots and AI have the potential to change how customers interact with businesses, making them more likely to choose a business over another option. By increasing efficiency and reducing customer friction, businesses can sell more products and services at a lower cost.

Technology also plays a vital role in the development of new business models.

Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from regularity?
Creativity is the ability of a person to come up with new and innovative ways to do something. It can be defined in many different ways, but in general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. This varies from person to person, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a definition. However, some key definitions of creativity include: • Artistry: The quality or practice of producing creative works • Innovation: Coming up with anew or novel solutions to problems or challenges • Creativity Loop: A continually evolving process that leads to new ideas and results 
What makes creativity so special? One major factor is that it doesn't always have a standard definition. Unlike regularity, creativity doesn't just involve coming up with new things- it can also involve coming up with ideas that are impossible to accomplish by any other means.
