Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started: 
1. Take a walk: Spending time outside is always a great way to think about new ideas. When you’re fresh and unafraid of new challenges, you may be more inspired to come up with new solutions. 
2. Draw inspiration from others: Not all ideas need an original solution, but looking at other people’s successes or failures can be inspiring. This will help you see what works and what doesn’t in your own business. 
3. Get help: There are plenty of resources available online and in books that can help you brainstorm and come up with new ideas.

Innovation is the key to success. It has been said that necessity is the mother of invention. This may be true, but without innovation, an invention is simply a solution to a problem that has already been solved. Innovation takes an invention one step further by not only solving a problem, but doing so in a way that is unique and original. This is what separates successful businesses from those that fail.
