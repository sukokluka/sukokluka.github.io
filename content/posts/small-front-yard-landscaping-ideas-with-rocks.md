What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work.

Ideas: What are some good ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to come up with new ideas and improve current ones. Here are a few ideas that may help you get started:
1. Create a new project or idea. This can be anything from designing a new shirt to coming up with a new business model. Just be sure that your idea is both innovative and feasible, as there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.

2. Take on an existing project. If your idea isn’t very different from what someone else has already done, it might be worth considering taking on an existing project. This can give you some experience and knowledge in the area in which you want to focus your efforts, as well as the support of other people who might have an expertise in that area.

3. Try out different methods ofexpression.
