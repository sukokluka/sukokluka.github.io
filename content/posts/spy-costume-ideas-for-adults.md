Creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas are something that come to people without warning. They can be something as simple as a new way of looking at an old problem, or a new way to do something you’ve always done but didn’t think of before. The important thing is that the idea has to be something that you can see yourself doing in the future, and that you can imagine living your life with. Here are four tips for coming up with creative ideas: 
1. Don’t force yourself to come up with ideas; let your mind wander. There are no right or wrong answers, just some helpful things to keep in mind when brainstorming: What do you want? What does this have potential to achieve? What would make this an interesting and useful addition to your product or service? How can you make it more efficiently or effectively?
