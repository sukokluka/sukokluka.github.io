Creative process: How does creative thinking happen?
Creative thinking is a process that starts with the idea and then it's refined into a creation. It can be something as simple as an idea for a new product or just a new way of looking at an old problem. Sometimes, the creative process can involve working on different versions of the same idea until one comes to mind that you're inspired to produce.

The Best Ideas: What are the best ideas?
Creative ideas are always a great way to get things started and can help you solve problems. Here are some of the best ideas on how to start working on your projects: 
1. Start with a blank slate: This is definitely one of the most popular ideas and can be used for both creative and everyday tasks. Create a list of ideas and then use them as a starting point for your next project. 
2. Take risks: When it comes to creativity, there’s no guarantee that everything will work out, but doing something new and risky can be a great way to get started. If something doesn’t work out, don’t be afraid to give up–you can always try again later. 
3. Collaborate: Collaborating with other people is another great way to get started on your projects.
