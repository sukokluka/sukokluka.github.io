The three types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, and Exact
Creativity is a result of the interaction between two or more factors. These factors can be called intuition and analysis, or exactly. Intuitive creativity is the result of an individual's natural ability to connect with the world and see patterns. Analytical creativity is founded on reason and analysis, which can help individuals see how things work and how they can be improved. 
Exact creativity is when an individual has a specific idea and they go into deep analysis to make it a reality. This type of creativity often requires focus and dedication, as it can be difficult to change your mind after you have initial ideas. However, if done correctly, this type of creativity can lead to amazing products and solutions.
