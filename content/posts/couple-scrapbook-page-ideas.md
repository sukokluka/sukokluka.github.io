In fact, some creativity comes from coming up with ideas that others may not even think of.

How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that involves the use of imagination and creativity. It is important to note that creativity does not work in a straight line, but rather it is constantly evolving. This means that it can change and develop over time. Creative art often contains elements of the Unknown or the inexplicable, which allows for the viewer to interact with the artwork in a different way than if it were just a series of instructions written down.

Types of Innovation:
It can be difficult to know what innovation is. For some, it’s a new technology or business model that is different from the ones currently in use.

When it comes to being creative, brainstorming is key. This technique allows you to explore all of the ideas in your head without judgement. By writing down every single idea, no matter how absurd it may seem, you open yourself up to possibilities that you may have never considered before. Brainstorming can be done alone or with a group, and it's a great way to generate new ideas.
