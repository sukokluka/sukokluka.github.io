Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
