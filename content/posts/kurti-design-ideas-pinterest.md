Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play.

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.
