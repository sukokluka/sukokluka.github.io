The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Creative ideas: How to come up with them?
Creative ideas are something that everyone has. Whether you’re a creative writer, artist, or just about anything else, creativity is always on the horizon. Here are 8 tips on how to come up with creative ideas:
1. Start with an idea and work from there. If you have an idea for a book, start by writing the first chapter and seeing what kind of feedback you get from readers. Once you have a feel for what works and doesn’t work in your book, then come up with some tweaks.

2. Get inspired by others. There are endless sources of inspiration when it comes to creative ideas! Look at paintings, sculptures, movies, TV shows – anything that inspires you in some way!

3. Take risks. When it comes to coming up with creative ideas, sometimes all it takes is a risk!
