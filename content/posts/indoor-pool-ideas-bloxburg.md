The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.
