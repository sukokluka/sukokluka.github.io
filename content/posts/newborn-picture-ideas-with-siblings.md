Invention is a new method, product, or idea. A definition of Invention can be found at the American Patent and Trademark Office. An invention is a new way of doing something, it can also include a new technology. Inventions can have many different applications, from everyday products to new medical treatments.

Creative process: How does creative thinking happen?
Creative thinking is a process that starts with the idea and then it's refined into a creation. It can be something as simple as an idea for a new product or just a new way of looking at an old problem. Sometimes, the creative process can involve working on different versions of the same idea until one comes to mind that you're inspired to produce.
