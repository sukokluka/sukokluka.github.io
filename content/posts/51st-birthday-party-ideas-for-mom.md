Decorating: How can you make your home look its best without spending a fortune?
There are many ways to decorated your home without spending a fortune. You can buy new art or accessories or make your own decorations with materials you have on hand. Here are some ideas to help you get started: 
1. Decorate the walls with art. Paint the walls in different colors and designs, add pictures, or use products like spray paint to create an ethnic look.

3. Add plants and flowers to your home in any way possible. Not only will this add decoration, but it also makes the environment more welcoming and stress-free. 
4. Get creative with window treatments and draperies.

How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.

It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses.

Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. There is no single answer to how or when brainstroming should be used in business, but there are some key principles to follow if you want to try it out for yourself.
