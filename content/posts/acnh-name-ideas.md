Offering a new product or service
A new product or service can be a big idea. It can be something that is different and exciting, or it can be something that is helpful and necessary. Whether it is a new way to cook your food, or a new way to keep your home clean, there are many options when it comes to creating a new product or service. 
One of the best things about offering a new product or service is that people are always curious. They want to see what it is and how it works. This curiosity can lead to increased sales for your company, as people want to know more about what you have to offer.

Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

At other times, companies can be credited for developing innovative products or services over time, such as Levi Strauss and Co.'s jeans becoming popular after they were first developed in the 1800s.
