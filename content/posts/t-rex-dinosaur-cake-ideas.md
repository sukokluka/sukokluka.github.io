Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be. It doesn't have to be something that's necessarily new, but something that will help your business or product stand out. Below are some ideas to get you started:
1. Create a Logo
A logo is the foundation of any business or product. A well- designed and executed logo can help make a company recognizable and sell its products. If you don't have a strong logo, consider hiring someone to create one for you.

2. Come up with a Unique Text Message
Text messages are an effective way to communicate with your customers and promote your business. They're also great for spreading the word about your product or service in a unique way. Find creative ways to send text messages that will resonate with customers and help build relationships with them.
