How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you?
How can you explore new ideas and find the ones that are most appealing to you? There are a number of ways to do this, but one of the most effective methods is by asking yourself what interests you. This will help you to develop ideas based on what you care about, and it will also help to narrow down your options. The next step is to look through existing ideas and see which ones might be a good fit for you. Once you have narrowed down your options, it’s time to start exploring them, by looking for examples and reading about them. Finally, keep in mind that not all ideas are created equal, so be prepared to test and experiment before making any decisions.

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.
