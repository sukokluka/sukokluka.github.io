What are your goals?
When it comes to goal setting, there are a few different things to consider. Whether you haveSpecific goals or general ones, the following are helpful tips:
1. Set specific deadlines: This is one of the most important things to remember when goal setting. If you don’t have a deadline, it will be much harder to get started on your goal. A good way to set a deadline is by saying that you want a certain outcome by a certain date (e.g., “I want my raise in two months”).

2. Create measurable goals: By using measurable goals, you can track and measure how well your goal is coming along. This helps you identify areas that need improvement and makes setting larger goals more manageable.

Pros and cons of doing the project
When it comes to doing DIY projects, there are pros and cons to each option. Some people may love the challenge of trying something new, while others may find it difficult to figure out what they're doing wrong the first time around.  So, which option is right for you? Here are seven tips on how to choose the right project for you.
