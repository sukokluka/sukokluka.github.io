Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!
