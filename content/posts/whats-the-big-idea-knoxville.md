Invention Benefits Society
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries. From the humble tools that farmers and peasants used to build their homes, to the technology that allows us to fly, today's inventions benefit society in many ways. 
Some of the most notable inventions include the printing press, which allowed for a greater variety of voices to be heard and ideas to be explored, as well as vaccinations and antibiotics. Others include automatic cars, home air conditioning systems and even 3-D printing. 
The benefits of inventions are vast and range from improving our quality of life to saving lives. With so many innovations on the horizon, it is important that society continues to support these advancements by investing in research and development opportunities.

The benefits of creative ideas.
Creative ideas can have a variety of benefits – from helping people find solutions to problems to boosting creativity. Here are four examples:
1. Creative ideas can help people solve problems. For example, a creative idea could be coming up with a new way to store food, such as using an airtight container or freezing food in order to make it last longer.

2. Creative ideas can also help people feel more Productive. When someone has a great idea for a product, they tend to be more inspired and motivated to produce the product themselves. This is especially true if the product is new and innovative – something that almost all products have at some point in their development cycle!

3. Finally, creative ideas can boost creativity overall.

Conclusion
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First, don’t worry about coming up with the “right” answer. There is no such thing when you’re brainstorming. The whole point is to come up with as many ideas as possible, even if they’re not all good. Second, allow yourself to think outside the box. The best ideas often come from thinking in a way that you wouldn’t normally. And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Brainstorming with someone else can give you some great new perspectives on an issue.
