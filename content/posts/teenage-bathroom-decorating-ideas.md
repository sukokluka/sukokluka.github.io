Stimulating creativity with prompts:
When it comes to creativity, there are a variety of ways to get those ideas flowing. One way is to use prompts. Prompts can help to stimulate the creative process by providing a structure or framework within which to generate ideas.
There are a number of different types of prompts that can be used, depending on what you’re looking to achieve. For example, if you’re looking for ideas for a new project, you might use a prompt that asks you to come up with three possible options for what that project could be.

The Process of Innovation
Innovation is the engine of growth for any organization. It can be a new product, a new service, a new process, or a new business model. But what does it take to be truly innovative?
There are four steps in the innovation process: idea generation, idea selection, implementation, and commercialization.

Idea generation is all about generating new ideas. This can be done through brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing customer behavior.

Idea selection is about choosing the best ideas and turning them into prototypes. This step requires input from different stakeholders within the organization, as well as customers.

Implementation is about taking the prototype and turning it into a reality. This includes testing, refining, and scaling the solution.

Commercialization is about bringing the innovation to market and making it available to customers.
