The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation. However, one of the most important aspects of creativity is divergent thinking. This is the ability to come up with multiple solutions to a problem or multiple ways to approach a task.

What is the best way to use new ideas?
There are many ways to use new ideas. Some people enjoy using them in new concepts or products, while others find them more useful when used in the context of a project. Whatever the case may be, here are three tips on how to properly use new ideas:
1. Make sure that the idea is well-received by everyone involved before moving forward with it. This includes your team and clients, as well as anyone who will be using or benefiting from the product or concept you've created.
2. Think about what you want your product or concept to achieve before starting development. This will help you ensure that your idea is both unique and effective.
3. Be willing to risk failure until you've proven that your idea is worth trying out for someone else.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
