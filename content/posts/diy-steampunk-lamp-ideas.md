What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of coming up with a new and original idea or approach to something. It can be anything from a new product or service to an innovative way of running a business. There are many types of innovation, but some are more popular than others. Here are four examples:
1. Creative invention – This type of innovation comes from coming up with an original solution to a problem that someone else had before you. This can be something as simple as creating a new type of bread recipe or developing a way to cut costs in your business.

2. Collective intelligence – This is when two or more people come up with an idea for solving a common problem and then work together to make it happen. This can be something as simple as coming up with a better way to stock shelves or finding new ways to sell products.

Invention: How did the inventor come up with their idea?
Invention ideas come from a variety of sources, including inspiration, observation, and trial and error.

They may also reference others who have had similar ideas to help them come up with their own version of the idea. Once they have a good idea, they continue to explore ways to make it more effective or efficient.
