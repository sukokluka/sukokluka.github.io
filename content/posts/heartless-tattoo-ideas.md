What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work. They can be something as small as a new product or service or as large as a new way of looking at the world. There are endless possibilities when it comes to big ideas, and there is no one right way to come up with them. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to let your brain explore new possibilities. When you’re starting out, it might be helpful to focus on just a few big ideas and see how they play out in your head. This will give you a good foundation for what else you might want to think about. 
2. Be creative.
