The history of invention: From ancient times to the modern day
Invention is the act of creating a new object or idea from scratch. It has been around for centuries, and some of the most iconic inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and insulin. However, there are also some less well-known inventions that have had a significant impact on our lives. For example, the condom was invented by a man named John Hargrave in 1877. He came up with the idea after seeing a group of men fighting outside his home. He realized that if he could create a device that prevented conception then he could prevent any future fights between men and prevent them from ending in bloodshed.

1. Make a list of ideas. This can be done in any format, but a list of ideas will help you to get started.
2. Think about how you can use the ideas on your list. If you cannot come up with an idea on your own, think about what others have done and what they used to achieve their goals.
3. Draw inspiration from other people and things around you. Studies have shown that imitation is one of the best ways to learn something new. Look at things around you and see how they have helped someone else achieve their goals or reached their dreams.
4: Take action! No matter what creativity may seem like, taking action is always the best way to go towards achieving your goals! Start by thinking of ways that you can improve or take actions that will help your creativity become successful.
