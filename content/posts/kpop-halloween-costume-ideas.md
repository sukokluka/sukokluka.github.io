Big Data: How big data is changing the way businesses operate and what implications this has for everything from marketing to customer service.
Big data is now a big part of business operations. How this affects everything from marketing to customer service is a topic of debate. Some businesses see big data as a way to increase efficiency and make decisions faster, while others are concerned that it could have negative consequences. Here are four examples of how big data is changing the business landscape:
1) They're using big data to assess customer needs and then cater to them with tailored marketing campaigns. Previously, businesses conducted marketing research through questionnaire surveys or focus groups. With big data, businesses can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze huge amounts of information about customers in order to better understand their needs and preferences. This allows companies to identify what products or services are most popular and need improvement, which in turn can lead to new product development or even new sales campaigns.
