The Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas can be classified into two main groups: propositional and non propositional. Propositional ideas are those that have a conclusion, or an idea about what something means. Non propositional ideas, on the other hand, do not have a conclusion, but rather they are about how something might happen.
