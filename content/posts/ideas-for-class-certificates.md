5) Use natural light to boost productivity
Light is one of the most important things in a person's life. It can help you focus, read, and do your work better. There are many ways to use natural light to boost productivity. Here are 5 tips:
1) Get a window that opens up onto natural light. This will allow you to get plenty of exposure to the sun.
2) Use sunlight exposure clocks to time your work periods so you can work more effectively in the morning and at night.
3) Make use of windows with high-quality blinds or curtains that block out all light. This will keep you productive while working in darkness.
4) Use a desk lamp rather than traditional office lights. This will allow you to see what you're working on more clearly and avoid eyestrain.
5) Work in bright or bright daylight whenever possible.

What new trends will we see in technology in 2022?
1. In 2022, we will see a continued trend of technology that is more artificial intelligence-driven and able to learn on its own. This will allow machines to do things that humans would have traditionally considered difficult or impossible, such as understanding natural language and pattern recognition.
2. We also expect to see a continued move in the field of virtual reality, which has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its ability to immerses users into another world where they can experience the same sensations as if they were there. This technology could be used for training new employees or salespeople, or even for entertainment purposes.

3. Another trend we can expect to see in 2022 is the growth of self-driving cars, which are becoming increasingly popular due to their safety and efficiency features.

The Idea: What is it? How can it be used?
Ideas are a great way to come up with new ideas. Some ideas are simple, while others may be more complex. However, they can all be used to improve the success of a project or to come up with new solutions to problems. Here are four examples of how ideas can be used in a project: 
1. A brainstorming session is a great way to get creative and come up with new ideas for a project.
2. If you have some specific goals for the project, you can use brainstorming sessions to help you achieve those goals.
3. Use ideas as part of your development process and see what comes out the most effective in terms of coming up with new solutions.

HistoricalBackground: Invention refers to the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task.
Invention is the use of new ideas or devices to improve or complete a task. The history of invention is filled with stories of people who came up with new ways to do things, and often these ideas led to new products, services, or treatments. Today, we continue to see innovation in all areas of life, from technology to fashion. In some cases, this has led to profound change for the world around us - for example, the development of the printing press and the telephone. In other cases, it has just meant more innovation in the ways we work and live.
