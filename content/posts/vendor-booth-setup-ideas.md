How inventions are created: by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error
inventive ideas are created by coming up with a creative plan or idea and then doing some trial and error. Sometimes, this process can be a lot easier than you think. If you're not sure how to start your own invention journey, here are five tips to get you started. 1) Think about what you want to create. What are your goals? What do you need to succeed? Once you have these answers, come up with a creative plan that will help achieve them. This will give you a better idea of what kind of ideas work and don't work for your product or service. 2) Be persistent. If it takes longer than expected to get started, don't give up! Keep at it until the project is more successful than when you started. 3) Take your time and make sure everything is in place before starting the experiment.

Wearables: What are some of the latest wearable inventions?
Some of the latest wearable inventions include smart watches, sleeves that keep you warm, and even a smart coffee mug. With so many new ideas on the horizon, it's hard to know which one to try first. So here are four tips to help you make the best choice:
1. Check out what's in stock first: One of the best things you can do when trying out a new invention is to check out what's in stock. This will give you a good idea of what type of product might be available for purchase. If there's something you're interested in but don't see on store shelves, ask your friends or family if they have any recommendations.

2. Consider size: Another thing to consider when looking at wearable inventions is how large or small they might be.
