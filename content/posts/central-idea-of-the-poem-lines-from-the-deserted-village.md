What are some ideas?
Ideas can be anything that works for you. Whether it's a new hobby, new way of looking at things, or a new way to approach an old problem, there are endless possibilities out there. But what are some ideas? Here are eight ideas to get you started: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to clear your head and start fresh is to take a break. Get up and walk around, do something physical, or read something inspiring. 
2. New perspective: If you're stuck on an issue, trying a different perspective can help solve it. Think about how other people have approached the problem before you and see if there's a different way to look at it.
