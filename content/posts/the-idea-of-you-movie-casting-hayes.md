Factors that influence the definition of a big idea
There are many factors that can influence the definition of a big idea. Some of these include the idea's popularity, its feasibility, and its novelty. Popularity is important because it can help to determine whether or not people are interested in the idea. Feasibility is important because it determines how easily the idea can be implemented. Its feasibility will also depend on whether or not someone has an understanding of the concept. Finally, novelty is important because it can change people's opinions on an issue. This can lead to a change in the way people think about the idea and potential implementation.

The history of innovation
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. The first instance of innovation was when early man used a sharpened rock to make a spear. This allowed him to kill animals for food and protect himself from predators. Since then, there have been many other instances of innovation.
The wheel is another example of innovation. It was invented by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. The wheel made it possible to transport goods and people over long distances. It also helped to speed up production in factories and workshops.

The printing press is another important invention that has had a major impact on the world. It was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it made it possible to mass-produce books and other printed materials. This had a huge impact on education and knowledge sharing.
