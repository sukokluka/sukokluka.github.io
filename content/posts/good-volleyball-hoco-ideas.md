Aesthetic preferences: What kind of things make someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors?
Creative endeavors can be both rewarding and challenging, but they always include some form of art. Whether it's the creation of beautiful paintings or the designing of innovative new technologies, artists are always working to improve their skills. One important aspect of artistic excellence is aesthetics, which refers to the way a person looks. There are a variety of factors that can influence an artist's appearance, and many people have different preferences when it comes to what makes someone look good or not so good in creative endeavors. Some people prefer simple, unadorned designs while others enjoy colorful and intricate pieces. Some people like their artwork to be popular and flashy while others prefer more introspective pieces that will get them noticed. However, there is no one definitive way that artists look good or bad in their work. It ultimately depends on how they approach their art and how they feel about themselves as individuals.

Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.
