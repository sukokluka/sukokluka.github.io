What are some ideas?
1. Come up with new and innovative ways to achieve your goals. 
2. Take a step back and think about what you want and how you can achieve it. 
3. Try new methods or strategies that may be less expensive or time-consuming than those you are familiar with. 
4. Be creative and come up with ideas that may not have been thought of before. 
5. Go beyond the basics and consider some ideas that are outside the box or difficult to imagine but possible in the future.

In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line.
