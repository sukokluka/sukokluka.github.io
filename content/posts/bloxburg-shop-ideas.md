How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.

How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful. And while using creativity in your everyday life may not sound as glamorous as being an artist or creative thinker, it can have major benefits at work.

Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.
