The Future of Innovation: What challenges will we face as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work?
One of the challenges facing humanity as we continue to explore new ways to approach life and work is that there is no one definitive answer to how innovation should be approached. Some argue for a more open-minded approach, in which innovation is seen as a tool that can be used for good, while others suggest that any new technology or approach should be tested and refined before it is put into widespread use. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure: There will always be people who argue for change, even when it comes to how we approach innovation.

Some of these innovative thinkers have had a lasting impact on society, while others have faded into obscurity. But all of them have left their mark on history in some way. Here are 5 examples.
1) Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type press in 1455 led to the printing press and the rise of printing technology as an important part of modern society.

2) In 1876, Bell Labs invented the telephone, which made communication much more accessible than it had been before.

3) The internet was first created in 1972 by mathematician Alain Robert et al., which allowed for greater access to information and education than ever before.
