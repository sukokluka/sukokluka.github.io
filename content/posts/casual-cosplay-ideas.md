Brainstorming with a team
1. When it comes to brainstorming with a team, there are a few things to keep in mind.
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means no judgement or criticism – just open-mindedness and respect for others’ opinions.

3. Secondly, try to come up with a structure for the brainstorming session beforehand so that it runs smoothly and efficiently. This could involve setting time limits for each topic, or having specific questions that you want to focus on.

4. Finally, don’t forget the power of visual aids! If you can find a way to visualize your team’s ideas, it will help everyone to better understand and remember them later on.
