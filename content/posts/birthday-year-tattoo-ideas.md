What is the definition of big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can also be difficult to come by. There are a few things that make big ideas successful, and those things depend on the individual. Some people find it easy to come up with big ideas, while others may have to work hard to come up with them.
The most important thing is that big ideas should have a clear vision and purpose. They need to be interesting and useful, and they should be something that people can be excited about. Once they’re developed, big ideas need to be abandoned if they don’t meet these requirements.

If you want to find out what makes big ideas successful, you need to ask yourself a few questions. What are your goals? What does the audience want? What do you think will make the idea interesting and user-friendly? Are you worried about potential roadblocks or problems?

Immigration and Customs Enforcement: What changes will need to be made to deal with this growing problem?
The number of people apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has increased by 50 percent in just five years, according to a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The report also found that CBP is struggling with the increasing number of asylum seekers and refugees, as well as its own staffing shortages.
One solution to the problem may be to consider changes to how the agency handles immigration. One idea would be to relax requirements for criminal background checks on those seeking entry into the country, which can lead to more individuals being admitted without proper vetting. Another idea would be to increase funding for CBP so that it can properly patrol the country's borders and handle operations like search and seizure in more efficient ways.
