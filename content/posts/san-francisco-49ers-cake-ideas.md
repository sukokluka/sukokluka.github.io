The history of creative art: How does it start?
Creative art has a long and complex history, with different people and cultures contributing to its creation. One of the earliest examples of creative art was considered to be cave art, which was discovered in France in the late 1800s. This type of art involved artists creating pieces out of natural materials such as flint and obsidian. It is thought that these artists used their creativity to escape from reality and explore their inner world. From there, other forms of creative art began to emerge, including sculpture and painting. While both types of art have their own unique strengths, they are united by the fact that they are created using inspiration and ideas from outside of the artist’s own experience.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new way of looking at things. Invention can come from anyone, but often it is the work of men. Men are more likely to come up with ideas than women, and they are also more likely to be creative. Invention has always been an important part of human history and has made major contributions to our world.
