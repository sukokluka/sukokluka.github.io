What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are some tips on how to find inspiration: 
-Look at what people have already done. This includes looking at art, design, and architecture. Try to see how they have created things that you like and then apply those ideas to your project. 
-Try different methods of creating something new. Use pens, pencils, paper, paints, or clay to create new things. Not everything needs to be composed in words. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective to start fresh and get inspired.

Brainstorming Tips: How do you best use brainstorming to come up with new ideas?
brainstorming is an effective tool for coming up with new ideas. However, there are a few things you can do to make the process more efficient and effective. First, try to group your ideas together so that they are easier to understand.
