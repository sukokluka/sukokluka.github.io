Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.

The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.
