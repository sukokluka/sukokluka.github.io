Why do we need ideas?
Think about the last time you came up with an idea. How did it feel? Did everything click into place and do what you wanted? If not, why not?
Ideas are essential to our success. Without them, we would be at a disadvantage in any field we choose to pursue. However, they can also be frustrating and time-consuming to come up with. So how do we make sure that our ideas turn into successful projects? Here are a few tips: 

1) Make sure your ideas are grounded in reality 
Ideas should only be based on what you've seen or experienced before. Otherwise, they will likely be scrapped before they even get started. 
2) Be organized and structured 
Ideas need to be broken down into specific steps and goals so that they can be completed quickly and easily.

Creative Approaches: What are some methods for coming up with ideas?
Creative Approaches to Ideas: 1. Brainstorming: Start by brainstorming all the possible ways that your idea could be developed. What are some ideas for stories, designs, products, or services? What are some ideas for marketing campaigns? What are some ideas for developing a business strategy? 2. Introspection: Take time to explore what you like and don't like about your idea. Are there any elements that you would like more attention to or that feel too limiting? Are there any areas where you can make your idea better? 3. Hypothesis: Now that you've explored what you like and don't like about your idea, it's time to come up with an introspective hypothesis about why people might want to use your product or service. What is the potential market for your product or service? How do you think people will use it?
