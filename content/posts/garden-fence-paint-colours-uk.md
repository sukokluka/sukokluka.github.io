The Origin of Invention: How did Invention come about?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as dreamt up in your head, or something more complex like developing a new product or technique. Inventions often come about when people come up with an idea that others may find valuable. Some inventions, such as the printing press, were developed for the purpose of helping people make money. Other inventions, such as the lightbulb, were created simply to make things better.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.
