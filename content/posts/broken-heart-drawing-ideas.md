The process of coming up with ideas: What tools do you need?
Ideas are hard to come by, but they're worth trying to get. There are a few tools that can help you come up with more ideas, but it takes time and effort. Here are some tips to help you get started: 1. Take some time for yourself. A lot of people think that if they just sit in front of their computer all day, they'll have great ideas. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. If you need some time for yourself, go for a walk or take a bath; those activities will give you an idea of what's important to you and when you might want to come back to your work. 2. Get inspiration from others. People around you can be a great source of inspiration when it comes time to come up with new ideas.

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.
