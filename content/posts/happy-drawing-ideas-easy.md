Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.

He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.
