Creative expression: What are the different forms of creative expression?
Creative expression is any form of art that is created for the express purpose of communicating, educating, entertain, or moving someone. It can be in the form of music, painting, sculpture, design, writing, or anything that is creative and expresses an idea or emotion. There are many different forms of creative expression and each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few examples: 
• Music: Music can be expressed in many ways, but one of the most popular forms is songwriting. Songwriters create lyrics and melodies based on their personal experiences and ideas. This allows them to focus on directly expressing their songs’ messages without worrying about censorship or repercusiveness. 

• Painting: Painting is another popular form of creative expression. Artists use a range of colors and mediums to create unique sculptures and paintings that explore different aspects of life.
