Define brainstorming.
Brainstorming is a process that allows you to generate ideas and solutions by working with a group. The goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or evaluating them. This can be done by writing down all the ideas that come to mind, or by using a technique called "brainstorming." Brainstorming is a technique that is used to generate new ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. The key to effective brainstorming is to suspend judgment and allow the free flow of ideas.
