Commercializing an invention: What is the commercialization process?
Commercialization is the process of bringing an invention to market and making it available to the general public. There are a number of different commercialization processes that can be used to bring an invention to market. The most common process is license-back, in which the inventor and licensee agree on a royalty schedule and terms of use. License-back usually occurs when an invention is filed with the USPTO. License-backs are also common when a patent application is filed with the USPTO. Other commercialization processes include industriallicense, which involves selling rights to use an invention in a specific industry; technologylicense, which allows manufacturers or other businesses to use an invention in order to create products or services; and netpatent, which allows inventors to make money by selling patents they receive from others.

The Future of Employment: How will joblessness and automation impact employment?
As the world progresses, it is important to keep in mind that employment will continue to be a factor in society. This is especially true in the future as technology advances and joblessness becomes more widespread. One way that this could impact employment is through automation. Automation has the potential to reduce the number of jobs by making them more efficient and automated. Another implication of automation is that it could lead to people having less work to do. This could have a significant impact on society as a whole, especially if it leads to large numbers of people living in poverty.
