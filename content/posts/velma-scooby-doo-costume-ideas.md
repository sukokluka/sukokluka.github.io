Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, it’s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.

Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the driving force behind progress. It has led to the creation of technologies that have made our lives easier and more enjoyable. It is a process that involves the generation of new ideas, the development of those ideas into a plan or prototype, and the testing and refinement of the prototype. Inventors are people who are able to see beyond the status quo and imagine something better. They are creative problem-solvers who are always looking for ways to improve upon existing products or create entirely new ones. The invention process can be long and arduous, but the rewards can be great. Those who are successful in inventing something that makes a difference in the world can achieve fame and fortune.
