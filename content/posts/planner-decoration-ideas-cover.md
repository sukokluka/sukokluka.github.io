Creative process: What happens during the creative process?
Creative processes can vary depending on the person and the creative work they are working on. For example, one person might be creative during brainstorming sessions while another might need to be more specific in their ideas before starting to create anything. However, there are some commonalities between all creative people. They tend to be open-minded, multi-talented and want to explore new ideas constantly. The process of creativity is often seen as a journey, not a destination.
