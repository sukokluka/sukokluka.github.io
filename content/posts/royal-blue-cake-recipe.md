Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.

Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.
