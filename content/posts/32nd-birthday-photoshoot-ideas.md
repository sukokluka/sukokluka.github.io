The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions. In order to achieve success in any field, it is important to have a good understanding of creativity and its benefits. Here are three key points that can help you achieve success: 1. Creativity can help you solve problems. When you have an idea that is different than what others have tried before, it can be helpful to bring your own ideas to the table and see if they are able to work together. This allows for creative thinking and problem solving, which can lead to innovative ideas and products. 2. Creativity can help you build relationships with other people.

Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.
