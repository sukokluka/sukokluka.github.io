What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

The nature of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of thought?
Creativity is often considered to be a different form of thought than other forms of thought. This is because creativity involves the creation of new ideas and concepts that are not possible in other forms of thought. It is important to remember, though, that creativity does not require an empty mind or an expansive imagination. In fact, creativity can be developed through any type of activity that allows for thinking outside the box.
