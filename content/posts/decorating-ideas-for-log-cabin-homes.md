Creativity and professionalism: How do you use creativity in your job?
Creativity and professionalism are two important aspects of any job. If you want to be a successful artist, you need to be able to come up with creative ideas. If you want to be a professional doctor, you also need to be able to come up with innovative ways to help patients. In both cases, creativity and professionalism are essential.
If you want your work to look professional, you need to use creativity as often as possible. For example, when brainstorming new ideas for a product or company, always include some creative ideas in your mind. Even if they’re not exactly what you’re thinking of right now, working on some creative projects will help make your work look more polished and professional.

Ultimately, being creative and professional is important in any career.

What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials.
