Creative writing:
Creative writing is a process of coming up with new and unique ideas for stories and novels. It can be quite fun to come up with new plots, characters, and settings, and to see what different people think of your work. However, it can also be difficult to make your ideas come alive in a way that makes them interesting and engaging reading experience. Here are some tips on how to get started in creative writing: 
1. Make sure you have a clear vision for your story. Once you have an idea for what you want your story to be, it’s important to make sure that the story fits within that vision. If you don’t have a solid plan for how your story will play out, it may end up becoming something that’s far from interesting or engaging reading experience. 

2. Be patient.

How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.
