The Future of Invention: What We Can Expect from Its explosive Growth
Invention is one of the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal. It can solve some of the world's biggest problems- from developing new drugs to design new transportation systems. But as it grows ever more popular, innovation may also come at a cost. If scientists and entrepreneurs don't keep up with the pace of invention, they could lose out on key opportunities to make a significant impact on society.
That's why it's important for society to continue to invest in innovation- not just because it helps us solve big problems, but because it can help us create new ways of life that are better for everyone. That's what we should expect from Invention's explosive growth.

The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.
