The benefits to creativity: How does creativity help us achieve our goals?
Creativity is frequently seen as one of the biggest benefits to having a creative mind. It can help you achieve your goals more efficiently and effectively, and it can also help you develop new skills. Here are some of the most common reasons why creativity is so beneficial: 
1. It can increase brainstorming and problem-solving abilities.

When you have a lot of ideas floating around in your head, creativity can help you come up with a solution that's more likely to work. And when it comes to problem-solving, creativity can be an asset – it's often better than relying on pre-determined solutions. 

2. It can make you faster learners.

One of the best things about creativity is that it gives you the opportunity to learn quickly and assimilate new information.

Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.
