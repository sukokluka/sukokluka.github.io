What is Invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design. Innovation is key to businesses and societies, both here in the United States and around the world. And while it can come from any form of creativity-from simple change to groundbreaking technology-invention has a special history and meaning in America.
It was on July 14, 1776, when Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that each state was an independent nation with its own rights and destiny. Inventions dating back to ancient Greece and Rome had helped make these ideas a reality. But what made America unique? The answer lies in its history of innovation, not just as a country but also as a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their ideas and dreams.

Innovation is at the heart of American identity.

The Benefits of Innovation: Why are innovations successful? What are some common benefits?
Innovation is a process of exploring, testing and improving upon ideas. It has the potential to improve entire industries while making people's lives more comfortable and efficient. There are many benefits to innovation, including increased productivity, reduced costs, diverse product offerings and improved customer service.
There are several reasons why innovations are successful, but some of the most common are: 1) novelty – when something is different from what is already available, people tend to be interested in it; 2) risk-taking – when something is new and challenging, it can inspire people to take chances; 3) collaboration – when people are working together towards a common goal, they're more likely to come up with innovative solutions; 4) execution – ensuring that the innovation is implemented effectively can help increase its success rate.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.
