What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

Creative abilities: What are they and how do they differ from other abilities?
Creative abilities can be defined in many different ways, but the most commonly accepted definition is that creativity is a quality or state of being that enables people to come up with new and innovative ideas. This ability can differ from person to person, but typically it refers to a spark of inspiration or an idea that comes to mind.
There are several different ways creative abilities can be measured, including creative thinking tests and creative writing exercises. However, the most common way to measure creativity is through art or poetry. This is because art has the ability to stir emotions and evoke feelings in people, which can then be used as a measure of creativity.

There are also several other abilities that may contribute to creativity, such as problem-solving skills, listening skills, and communication skills. However, these Abilities do not typically go hand in hand with creativity.
