How does brainstroming work?
Brainstroming is a form of mental stimulation that allows people to focus and learn. It is commonly used in education, work, and other areas where explosions of information are needed. The process begins by sitting in a quiet room and focusing on one object for 30 seconds. Then, you must take a break for 3 minutes and come back to the object. This process is repeated 10 times. The goal of brainstroming is to create an mental explosion that will allow you to learn more quickly and effectively.

Idea generation: What makes some ideas more creative than others?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more creative than others, but there are some general principles that apply to all creative ideas.
One principle is that ideas should be original. Ideas that are based on other people's work or experience can be less creative because they're recycled or copied from other sources.

Another principle is that ideas should be fresh. Ideas that have been around for a while can become stale and unoriginal. Fresh ideas are always more innovative and exciting to think about.
