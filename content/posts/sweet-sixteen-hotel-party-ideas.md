How to Use Nice Ideas to Make a Great Product
Nice ideas are a great way to make a great product. By using nice ideas, you can increase the chances of success for your project. Here are five tips to help you use nice ideas to create a successful product:
1. Start with common problems and solutions. When you start with a problem or solution, you’re more likely to find common ground and develop an idea that everybody can understand.

2. Be specific. If you don’t have a good idea, it’s much harder to come up with something that people will want and use. Be sure to include enough detail so that potential customers can understand what they’re buying and why they should invest in it.

3. Be willing to pivot.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
