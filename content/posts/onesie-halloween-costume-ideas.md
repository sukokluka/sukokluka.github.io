Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.

Brainstroming is a mental disorder that refers to the phenomenon of focus on one or a small group of items in order to consume all of their importance. The person with brainstroming feels overwhelmed by the task at hand and becomes uninterested in anything else. Some people say that brainstroming can be a sign of mental illness, while others claim that it can simply be a result of overworked brain cells.

The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.
