How creativity is used in the creative process: creative drawings, paintings, poems, etc.
Creativity is a key component of the creative process. By using different creative methods, artists are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that can help them achieve their goals. For example, when creating a painting, a creative artist might use different colors to create a realistic scene. Similarly, when writing poetry, the writer may use alliteration or other forms of poetry to make the words seem more interesting. In both cases, the artist and writer are trying to find ways to express themselves through their art.

brainstorming is a process by which creative ideas are generated. It can be used to come up with solutions to problems, new concepts or just thinking out loud. There are different ways you can start brainstorming and it really depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for ideas for your next project then the best way to start is by talking to friends, family or others who have had the same experience. If you are looking for ideas for personal projects then there are many different ways to generate them. One way is by using online tools like Google Docs or Excel. Another way is by taking a walk around your neighbourhood and seeing what people are doing that might be inspiration for your own project. The bottom line is that regardless of what method you choose, always ensure that you are working in a productive manner and that you are making sure that your ideas get put into action.

The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.
