The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.

What are some good ways to come up with ideas?
Ideas are one of the most important things a person can have. They can help you come up with new ideas for products, services, or anything else you might need to do. Here are some tips on how to come up with ideas: 
1. Take a look at what people have been working on and see what works well for them. Sometimes the best way to figure out what someone is working on is to watch them work so you can copy their methods and approach. 
2. Look at other people’s work and see how they have approached problem solving. This will give you a good idea of what works well for others and you can adapt it for your own business. 
3. Talk to other businesses and see how they approach coming up with ideas.

The definition of creativity: How does it differ from other definitions?
Creativity is a field that encompasses many different definitions, but all of them share one common goal: to produce something new. Whether it’s creativity in the creative process itself or what people mean when they use the word, creativity can be defined in many ways. 
There are many different ways to define creativity, but all of them outline four core concepts: 1) The ability to take inspiration from others and create something new; 2) The ability to come up with solutions that haven’t been tried before; 3) The willingness to experiment and try new things; and 4) The drive to learn and grow. 

The definition of creativity can be very different depending on who you ask, but all of these core concepts are key when examining how creativity is defined in the world.
