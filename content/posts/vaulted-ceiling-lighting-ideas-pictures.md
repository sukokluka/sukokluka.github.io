Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

The importance of ideas
Ideas are the lifeblood of any organization. Without them, a company would be in trouble. They can be used to improve products or to create new ideas for businesses. But even more important, ideas are the engine that drives innovation and growth.
But what are they? How do they come about? And how do they affect our business?

Ideas come from all over the place. Sometimes they come from people who have had some great ideas, and other times they come from others who have had some great ideas but don't know how to put them into a product or service that can make money for the company.

Ideas also come from customers. Sometimes we get an idea from someone who is using our product or service, and sometimes we get an idea from somebody who is not using our product or service but thinks it would be a good idea.
