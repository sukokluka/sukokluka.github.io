The benefits of creative art: How does creativity benefit us?
Creativity has been shown to be beneficial in many ways, from helping people feel more creative and motivated, to improving our thinking and problem solving skills. However, there are also a number of other benefits that can come from creativity. Here are just a few: 
1. Increased understanding of complex topics. When people are able to understand complex concepts more clearly, they are better able to solve problems and make decisions. This is especially true when it comes to matters of the arts, as understanding how an image or painting is composed can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand. 

2. Increased expression and communication. People who are more creative often have more natural communication abilities than those who arenâ€™t. This is because creativity helps us express ourselves in a way that is both original and interesting.
