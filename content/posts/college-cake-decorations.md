What are some common mistakes people make when starting a Blog?

This can lead to posts being published without notice or without even having the opportunity to answer questions.

Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but there’s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, it’s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work. They can be something as small as a new product or service or as large as a new way of looking at the world. There are endless possibilities when it comes to big ideas, and there is no one right way to come up with them. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to let your brain explore new possibilities. When you’re starting out, it might be helpful to focus on just a few big ideas and see how they play out in your head. This will give you a good foundation for what else you might want to think about. 
2. Be creative.
