Invention as a process: How does an inventor create a new product or idea?
Invention can be defined as the process of creating a new product or idea. Inventions result from the combined efforts of an inventor and their team. The team may include scientists, engineers, and designers. The goal of the team is to come up with a solution that meets the needs of the customer or user.
Invention is often a difficult process because it involves many steps and requires a lot of creativity.

Conclusion: Why should we care about invention?
Invention is the creative process of coming up with a new idea or design. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. The invention of the printing press was an incredible event in human history, and it is also responsible for many medical advances. There are countless other examples that can be provided, but the point is that invention is important.
There are several reasons why innovation should be taken seriously. First, innovation allows companies and countries to come up with new products and technologies faster than they would otherwise be able to. Second, it helps businesses make money by creating new ideas and products that people will want to buy. Third, innovation can help scientists learn more about how the world works and how to better understand problems. Finally, innovation can help society function more efficiently – for example, by developing new ways of warfare or managing social networks.

Technology Transfer: What are some ways that an inventor can get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product?
Inventors often need to get new technology licensed, patented, or developed into a real product in order to make a profit. There are many ways that an inventor can do this. Some ways include: 
1. Contact companies who make access to new technology difficult. This could be done by contacting companies who make it difficult for others to get access to new technology, such as those who control the patents and copyrights for the technology. 
2. Contact tech companies who make it difficult for others to bring new technology to market. These tech companies might include those that produce computer viruses, those that produce software that is difficult to uninstall, or those that make it difficult for others to find information about new technologies. 
3. Get involved with technical societies and technology groups who specialize in promoting new technologies.
