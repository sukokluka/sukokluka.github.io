Brainstroming is a process of rapidly focusing on one’s surroundings in order to solve a problem. The brain is able to do this because it has two different types of cells, which are called gray and white cells. Gray cells focus on what they see in front of them, while white cells focus on the past and future. Brainstroming is a great way to think fast and solve problems.
