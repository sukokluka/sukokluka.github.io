Definition of Innovation: What is new or different about a product or service?
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, innovation is “the process of making something new and different, typically by applying creative thinking and resourcefulness.” Innovation can be found in products, services, and even ideas.

1. Innovation can refer to any change that makes a product or service better or more efficient.
2. Innovation can refer to any approach that is different from the norm in order to improve customer satisfaction or business success.
3. Innovation can refer to anything that allows businesses to make changes in their products and services in order to improve them for their customers or themselves.
