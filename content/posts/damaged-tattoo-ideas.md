Research: How can you test your hypothesis?
In the 1970s, scientists were using what is now known as “the scientific method.” This method involved testing a hypothesis with experiments. Today, scientists use a variety of methods to test their hypotheses, including “gambling on the theory.” In this technique, people bet money on whether or not a particular theory will be proven true. If the bet is successful, then the theory is considered true; if not, then the theory is considered false. gambling on theories can help scientists learn more about their research subjects and make better decisions about what to study.
