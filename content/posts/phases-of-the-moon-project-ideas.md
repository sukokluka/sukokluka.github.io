Introduce the topic of inventions.
Invention ideas are everywhere, and it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few tips on how to come up with invention ideas that could make your life easier.
Start by looking at the problems you face in your everyday life. What are some things that you wish were different or that you wish you had? These problem areas could be potential starting points for your invention idea.

You can also look to other people for inspiration. Talk to friends and family members about the things they find frustrating or difficult in their daily lives. See if they have any suggestions for improvements that could make their lives easier.

Once you have a general idea of what you want to invent, it’s time to start doing some research. See if there are already products on the market that address the problem you’re trying to solve.

Causes of creative destruction: The creative process and its various variables
Creative destruction refers to the ability of new technologies, ideas, and processes to change the way businesses operate and create new opportunities. In today's economy, creative destruction is more than just a trend; it's a reality.
While there are many reasons behind creative destruction, one important factor is the ever-changing landscape of technology. As new devices and platforms arrive, old ways of doing business are no longer enough to keep up with the new competition. Businesses must adapt or perish.

One example of this is music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services offer a unique way for listeners to access all types of music, from popular hits to obscure albums. While Spotify has been around for years and Apple Music was only released last year, both services have already made a name for themselves in the market.

This innovation is not limited to music either.
