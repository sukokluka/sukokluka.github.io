Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

2. Machine learning – This field is rapidly developing and has the potential to change many aspects of our lives, from business to healthcare. It involves building algorithms that can learn from data and make decisions on their own. This could lead to huge improvements in our understanding of the world around us, as well as new ways of detecting and responding to dangerous situations.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work. They can be something as small as a new product or service or as large as a new way of looking at the world. There are endless possibilities when it comes to big ideas, and there is no one right way to come up with them. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to let your brain explore new possibilities. When you’re starting out, it might be helpful to focus on just a few big ideas and see how they play out in your head. This will give you a good foundation for what else you might want to think about. 
2. Be creative.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

Conclusion: What are some tips for coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new concept for a business to coming up with a new design for a shirt. There are many creative ideas out there, but it can be hard to come up with the right one. Here are some tips to help you come up with the best ideas: 
1) Take some time to think about what you want your idea to say. What is your message? Are you trying to create something new or improve an existing product? If so, think about how you could make your idea more unique and interesting. 
2) Consider what others might want or need. Not all ideas should be based on what people might want or need. Sometimes, you can come up with an idea that is completely unrelated and still be effective. 
3) Be patient and don’t expect everything to happen at once.
