Conclusion: How does creativity work and how can we use it to our advantage?
Creativity is an important part of any business. By using creativity, businesses can come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can help businesses reach new heights in their industry or achieve specific goals. Here are a few tips on how to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Ideas are not came from a vacuum; they come from what you have in your periphery. When you start taking things apart and looking at them from other angles, you will get more creative ideas. This is especially true when it comes to brainstorming – by breaking things down into smaller pieces, you are more likely to come up with multiple different solutions that may be better for the company. 

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks; if something feels unorthodox or risky, it is likely because it is.

The Evolution of Invention: From the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World
Invention is the process by which humans come up with new ideas, products, or methods. Innovation has been a part of human culture for as long as humans have been able to create things. The ancient Greeks were some of the first to come up with inventions. They had a system in which they would submit new ideas to a panel of judges, and if they were found to be good, they would be printed out and given to other people. The judges would then use their judgement to decide who should get the idea and who should make it into a product.
The modern world is full of invention. We have technology that allows us to create anything we want, and we can also find ways to improve on what others have created before us. This makes innovation something very important for humanity.
