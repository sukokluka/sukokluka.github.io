The Process of Innovation
Innovation is the engine of growth for any organization. It can be a new product, a new service, a new process, or a new business model. But what does it take to be truly innovative?
There are four steps in the innovation process: idea generation, idea selection, implementation, and commercialization.

Idea generation is all about generating new ideas. This can be done through brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing customer behavior.

Idea selection is about choosing the best ideas and turning them into prototypes. This step requires input from different stakeholders within the organization, as well as customers.

Implementation is about taking the prototype and turning it into a reality. This includes testing, refining, and scaling the solution.

Commercialization is about bringing the innovation to market and making it available to customers.

Some inventions are so important that they have caused entire civilizations to change. Others are simply nifty gadgets that few people ever encounter. But no invention is without its challenges. Each new invention presents new opportunities and threats to society, and scientists working on new technologies must constantly weigh the risks and rewards of their work against the potential consequences of their innovations.
