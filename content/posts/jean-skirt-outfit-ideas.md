2) Set up a work space on the bottom of your stairs
When it comes to work, having a space on the bottom of your stairs is a essential part of the equation. Not only does this give you more storage for your tools and materials, but it also creates a more comfortable environment for working. Here are two easy diy ideas that can help make your staircase work space even better:
1. Create an extra work area on the bottom step by installing a power drill, saw, screwdriver and other tools above the stair rail. This will make it easier to access everything you need without having to search through a pile of tools on top of your head.

2. Use old pieces of furniture (or hunt down some cheap Craigslistops) to create makeshift benches or tables. Simply staple pieces of plywood directly against the wall or use screws to hold them in place.

The power of creativity
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It is the ability to see things differently, to make connections that others don’t see, and to come up with new ideas and solutions.
Creativity is what allows us to solve problems, to invent new technologies, and to create works of art that move and inspire us. It is the engine of progress. And it is something that we all have within us.

So why is creativity so powerful? One reason is that it helps us to see the world in new ways. When we are faced with a problem, creative thinking allows us to find new solutions that we might not have otherwise considered.

Another reason is that creativity allows us to tap into our imagination and come up with ideas that are truly original.

Outdoor projects: How to fix a broken window, install a new deck, or repaint your house.
If you're looking to fix a broken window or install a new deck, there are a few things you can do to help. Here are some easy diy projects to get started:
1. Fix a Broken Window

One way to fix a broken window is to use your hands. Get some adhesive and put it on the inside of the windowpane. Once it's set, hold onto the edge of the adhesive and pull the window open. You could also use screws if the window frame is strong enough to hold itself together without help. If all of this doesn't work, call a professional!

2. Install a New Deck or Decking

Another option for fixing a broken window is to install new decking or railing. This can be done either in-home or at an outdoor location.
