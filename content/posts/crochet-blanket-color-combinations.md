A recent report on the future of technology suggests that a number of new ideas are emerging for improving ways to connect people and create opportunities.

Another is the development of artificial intelligence (AI)powered assistants that can assist people with their day-to-day tasks, from booking appointments to grocery shopping. While these ideas may seem like small tweaks to existing workflows, they could have large implications for businesses and society as a whole.
