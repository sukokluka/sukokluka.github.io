Painting the Walls: A guide on how to get the job done right.
If you're looking to paint the walls yourself, there are a few things that you'll need before getting started. First, you'll need a hammer and nails. Next, you'll need a drill or an impact driver. Finally, you'll need some painting supplies: paint, brushes, and a palette. Here's a guide on how to get the job done right: 
1) Begin by sketching out your design on some paper. This will help you to plan out the colors and features of your wall. 
2) After drew up your design, start by measuring the space that you want to cover. Once you've determined what size mural you want to create, be sure to add in any necessary trimming and framing.
