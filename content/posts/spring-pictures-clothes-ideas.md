1. Improved security and privacy - With more information available online, people are more likely to be careless with their personal data. This could lead to a rise in cybercrime, as criminals can use this information to steal from individuals or organizations. 
2. New ways of communicating - Technology has given us new ways of communicating which could have serious implications for our society and economy. For example, we could see a rise in virtual reality, which allows people to experience different worlds without ever leaving their homes. This could have important implications for the future of work and education, as well as how we interact with others online.
