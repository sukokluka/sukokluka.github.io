Ideas for shopping: What are some creative ideas for shopping?
Creative ideas for shopping can be anything from finding new and interesting fashion items to picking out the perfect gift. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1. Check out a new store that specializes in unique or unheard of items. This could be an old, discontinued store, or a store that is only open during special events or sales. It's always fun to check out something different and exciting! 
2. Go on a Shopping Spree! This means going to several different stores and trying on different items, choosing what looks best on you and taking home as many clothes as possible. It can be fun to see how each store compares and find the best deals!
