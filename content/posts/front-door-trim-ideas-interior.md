5. The Invention of Life
In 1846, a French scientist named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the theory of evolution. Lamarck said that life arose from the combination of different species, and that this process could be seen in animals as well as plants. The theory helped to change how people thought about life and the universe, and it eventually became a part of what we know as science.

How do we create innovative products?
Innovation is the ability to create new products or services that solve a problem that was not previously considered. For some businesses, innovation can come from coming up with a new way to do something, getting better at what you do, or even creating something entirely new. In other cases, innovation can come from taking an existing product and making it better. Sometimes this is easy- like when a business comes up with a new way to make their product more efficient- and sometimes it takes more effort, like when a company comes up with a revolutionary new technology. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to stay ahead of the curve and give their customers the best possible experience.
