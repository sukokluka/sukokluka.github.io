Overcoming creative blocks.
Creativity is a trait that is often associated with artists, musicians, and other professionals in the arts. However, creativity is not just a talent that only these people possess. Everyone has the ability to be creative, but sometimes we can get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to be creative. If you're feeling uninspired, here are a few tips to help you overcome your creative block.
1. Take a break from your project. Sometimes the best way to get out of a funk is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Step away from your work and clear your mind. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. When you come back to your project, you'll have fresh eyes and a new perspective.

2. Talk to other people about your project.

How can we use our time off work to improve our productivity?
Everyone has different work habits, and it can be difficult to stick to a specific schedule when taking time off for vacation. If you want to improve your productivity, there are a few ideas to consider. Here are three tips that can help you achieve better results: 
1. Make a list of the tasks that need to be completed in order for you to meet your goal. This will help you plan out what needs to be done and make sure that it is within your available time frame. 
2. Use technology tools such as calendars or email reminder systems to keep track of when you have free time. This will allow you to set aside specific times each week and not let work take over completely. 
3. Try out different methods of communication with co-workers in order to get them on the same page about how they can improve their productivity too.
