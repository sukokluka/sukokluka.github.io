The benefits of brainstorming
Brainstorming is a great way to generate new ideas, and can be done either alone or in a group. When brainstorming, it is important to suspend judgment and allow all ideas to be considered. This can help prevent “groupthink”, where people only consider ideas that are similar to what they already know. Brainstorming can also help people come up with creative solutions to problems.
There are many different ways to brainstorm, but one popular method is called “brainstorming by free association”. This involves coming up with words or phrases that are related to the topic at hand, and then using those words or phrases to generate new ideas. Another method is called “brainstorming by analogy”, which involves thinking of similar situations or problems and how they were solved.

The role of innovation in business: What are some applications of innovation?
Innovation is a term that is often used in business to describe new ideas or methods that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a business. This can be achieved through technological innovations, business model changes, or even product design changes. In recent years, innovation has become more important in businesses as it has become more difficult for companies to stay afloat with traditional methods such as investment and marketing. One way that businesses can use innovation to their advantage is by using it to improve customer service. By taking advantage of new technologies and developing processes that are less time-consuming, businesses can save time and money on customer service. Additionally, by using innovative marketing strategies, businesses can reach a wider audience and increase sales. The role of innovation in business is constantly changing and depends on the specific needs of the business. However, some applications of innovation are always beneficial for businesses.
