Tips for staying creative
Creativity is key to any business. Whether you're a creative individual or a small business owner, staying creative is essential for success. Here are some tips to help you stay creative: 
1. Consider your target audience: When thinking about how to be creative, it's important to consider what your target audience is. What are they interested in? What can you share with them that will interest them? This information can help you create content that will resonate with your audience. 

2. Create interesting ideas: When you have an idea for something, don't just go with the first thing that comes into your mind. Instead, think of ways that you could make this idea even more interesting and unique. This could involve coming up with different ideas for products or services, or creating a new concept that nobody has thought of before.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Puskás in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.
