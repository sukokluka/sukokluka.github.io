Creative ideas: What are some good ways to come up with new ideas?
Creative ideas can come in many forms, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. This is a process where you take whatever you think of and turn it into a plan. Once you have a plan, it's time to start thinking about how to put your ideas into practice. Here are some helpful tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1) Start with small concepts. When you have a lot of Ideas, it can be difficult to filter them all down into something that will work well. Smaller concepts are easier to think about and can be implemented quickly.

2) Take things one step at a time. When you're brainstorming, it's important to try and keep everything in mind at the same time so that you don't get overwhelmed. Instead, focus on one or two main ideas and go from there.

what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.
