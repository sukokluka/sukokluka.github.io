Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

Overcoming blocks to creativity
When it comes to being creative, there are a lot of things that can hold us back. Whether it's fear, self-doubt, or just not knowing where to start, these blocks can keep us from coming up with great ideas.
But the good news is that there are ways to overcome them. By taking some time to understand what's holding you back, you can start to break through and come up with the creative ideas you've been wanting to have.

Here are a few tips for overcoming some of the most common blocks to creativity:

1. Fear of failure. Many people don't want to try something new because they're afraid of failing. But the only way to really fail is by not trying at all. So instead of letting your fear hold you back, use it as motivation to push yourself further.

2. perfectionism.
