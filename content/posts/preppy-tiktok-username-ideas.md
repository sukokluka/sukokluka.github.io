Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

How can you get started with creative art?
Creative art is something that anyone can do, regardless of experience or skill level. All you need is a willingness to experiment and explore, and you can create something truly unique and beautiful. Here are a few tips to get started with creative art:
1. Find your medium. Whether you prefer painting, sculpture, photography, or any other type of art, find the medium that speaks to you and start experimenting.

2. Let go of perfectionism. Creative art is about expression and experimentation, so don’t worry about making mistakes. Embrace the imperfections and see what kinds of interesting results they produce.

3. Follow your instincts. Trust your gut feeling when it comes to creating art – chances are, if you feel drawn to certain colors, materials, or subjects, there’s a reason why.
