Why and how do people come up with new invention ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, both within and outside of the inventor themselves. Sometimes, an idea is sparked by something that the inventor sees or hears. Other times, someone else has an idea that the inventor thinks could be improved. In either case, it is important to find out why the inventor came up with the idea in the first place and how they went about making it a reality.

Conclusion
After spending hours brainstorming and developing your invention idea, it's finally time to reach a conclusion. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you wrap up your project:
1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. If you can't articulate the problem, you won't be able to sell your invention idea to others.

2. Do your research! Inventors who are well-informed about their industry and their competition are more likely to be successful. Make sure you know what's already out there and what needs improvement.

3. Have realistic expectations for your invention idea. It's important to be confident in your idea, but remember that not every great idea will become a multimillion-dollar business. Be prepared for bumps in the road and set reasonable goals for yourself and your team.
