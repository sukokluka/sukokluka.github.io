How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.

The Future of Education: What will be the future of education?
The future of education is a question that has been asked for centuries and will continue to be asked in the coming years. Many different ideas have been proposed as to what the future of education should be, but no one single answer has emerged as the definitive answer. Some possible answers include: 
"Equality of opportunity" 
"Universal Basic Education" 
"Teacher training programs for all skill levels" 
" computer-assisted learning "
In terms of ideas, the most likely answer would be a form of universal basic education. This would provide all citizens with equal access to education, regardless of their economic status or educational qualifications. Another idea that has been proposed is teacher training programs for all skill levels. This would allow people of all skill levels to learn how to teach, which would then help reduce teaching costs and improve overall school quality.
