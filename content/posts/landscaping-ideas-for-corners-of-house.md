Some inventions are so important that they have changed the way the world works, such as the computer and telephone. Others are simply bizarre, like a Bob-omb that can walk and talk.

Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

Invention history: How did some inventions become successful?
Invention history is a long and flexible way to describe the process of creating something new. From the early days of mankind, when people were just starting to learn how to make things, Invention has always been an important part of human life. Sometimes, an idea can be very simple, and other times it may be more complex. But in both cases, it can bring about a lot of change and improvement for those who come up with it. Here are some examples of inventions that have made a big difference in the world:
1. The Telephone: This invention was actually two separate ideas – one by Alexander Graham Bell and the other by Samuel Morse. Both men were working on different projects at the time, but they came up with a working prototype together. In 1876, they announced their findings to the public and quickly became famous for their work.
