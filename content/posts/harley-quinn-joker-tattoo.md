What is creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be described in many ways, but one definition of creativity is "the power of the imagination." It can be used to create things that we never thought possible, or to come up with new ways to do things we've been thinking about for years. Some people say that creativity is what makes us human, and it's what makes us most creative.
