Introduce the topic of inventions.
Inventions are ideas or objects that are created with the purpose of solving a problem or making life easier. Inventors are people who come up with these ideas and create them.
Some inventions are world-changing, like the telephone or the airplane. Others solve more everyday problems, like a better mousetrap or a self-tying shoelace. No matter how big or small, all inventions start with an idea.

If you have an invention idea, the first step is to figure out if it’s something that people actually need or want. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to start working on making your invention a reality.

How to Innovate
Innovation is a key term when it comes to staying ahead of the competition. By understanding how innovation works, businesses can develop innovative ways to stay one step ahead. Here are three tips to help you achieve success:
1. Look at innovation from a systemic perspective. When looking at innovation from a systemic perspective, businesses should take into account the entire supply chain and the entire market. This means understanding how products and services are used and what opportunities exist for improvement.

2. Try out different methods of thinking. When trying out different methods of thinking, businesses should experiment with different ideas and see which ones work best for them. This will help them determine which innovations are most important to their business and which ones need further development.

3. Be patient with your experimentation.

Overcoming creative blocks
There are many ways to overcome creative blocks. Some people find that taking a break from their work and doing something completely different helps them to refresh their ideas. Others find that talking to someone else about their project can give them new perspectives.
Some people find it helpful to set strict limits on their work in order to force themselves to be more creative. For example, they may give themselves an hour to come up with an idea for a new painting or only allow themselves to use three colors in their next piece of pottery.

 Whatever method you use, it is important to remember that there is no one right way to overcome creative blocks. What works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to keep trying new things until you find what works for you.
