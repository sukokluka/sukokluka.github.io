1. When it comes to brainstorming with a team, there are a few things to keep in mind.
2. First and foremost, itâ€™s important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means no judgement or criticism â€“ just open-mindedness and respect for othersâ€™ opinions.
