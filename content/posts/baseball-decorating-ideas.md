How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure. Have you ever tried something and it didn't work out? Don't be afraid to give up. You can always try again later if the first attempt doesn't work. 3) Have a plan. A plan is key in making sure that your creative project goes smoothly and that you don't run into any problems along the way. 4) Be willing to grow and learn.

Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?
