Creative Ideas For You: What do you have in mind that you haven't thought of before?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with creative ideas. First, think about what you want your idea to accomplish. Sometimes all it takes is a little creativity and inspiration to come up with something new and exciting. Second, make sure that your idea is feasible. If your idea doesn't have a lot of money or time put into it, it might not be worth your while to pursue it. Finally, make sure that your idea is funny or entertaining enough before you even think about pursuing it. These three points will help make any creative ideas more likely to become reality.

Brainstroming is a technique used in the mental health field to help people focus and organize their thoughts. The term was first introduced in the 1970s by psychiatrist Melvin Konner and his colleague Joseph Goldstein, who developed the cognitive therapeutic intervention called self-actualization. Brainstroming is also known as meditative meditation, focus meditation, or mindfulness meditation.
