Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Don’t steal other people’s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
2) Use your imagination. When you come up with creative ideas, don’t just think about what might work – try out different scenarios and see what comes up.
3) Get feedback from others. Take the time to ask people who have experience with the product or problem you’re thinking of solving how they would approach it. This will help you develop your idea into something that is both effective and appealing to potential customers.

Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.
