The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.
