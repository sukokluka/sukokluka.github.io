Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

Brainstorming: How do you come up with ideas for your blog or article?
Brainstorming ideas for your blog or article can be one of the most fun and rewarding aspects of writing. Not only do you get to think up new ideas, but you also get to share your own with others. Here are a few creative ways to come up with brainstorming ideas for your next blog post or article:
1. Take on a project that you have always wanted to do but never found the time to do. This could be something as simple as creating a list of all your favorite foods from around the world, or taking on a project that has been on your radar for a while but you just haven’t had the time to dive into it.

2. Take on an existing topic and see if you can make it more creative and interesting by exploring different angles or points of view.
