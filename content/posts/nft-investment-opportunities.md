Conclusion: What is creativity and what can it do for us?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be used for good or bad. The good side of creativity is that it can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, and ways to improve our lives. The bad side of creativity is that it can cause us to be creative and think outside the box, but also can lead us astray from the paths we were meant to take. Despite these risks, creativity is something that should be cherished and appreciated.

Types of innovation:
Innovation is the process of producing a new product, service, or idea that uses existing technology. Innovation can come from a variety of sources, such as creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. 
One of the most common types of innovation is using technology to improve the quality of life for people. For example, Apple has developed technologies that make it easier for people to communicate with one another and make more efficient use of their time. 

Innovation can also come from cutting-edge research and development. This type of innovation often creates new products or services that are not possible with the current technology. For example, Google’s Nexus series devices allow users to access new apps and features without having to worry about getting your hands on an outdated model. 

There are many different types of innovation that can be successful in different industries.
