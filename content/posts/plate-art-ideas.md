Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.

1) Redefine your idea of what a "safe job" looks like
Safe job is not the same as a good job. It may be safe for you to work, but it's not a good job. A safe job is one that does not involve danger, stress, or danger to yourself or others. Keywords: Ideas 202

The challenges of innovation: How does society respond to new ideas?
Innovation is not a one-time event but rather a continuous journey. Society has to be ready for the next big thing and respond quickly to new ideas. It can be difficult to keep up with changes in technology, society and business. This can lead to innovation being stagnant or even disappearing. There are several ways society responds to new ideas, but some of the most common are stifling innovation, fostering it and supporting it.
