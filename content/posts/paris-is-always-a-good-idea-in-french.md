Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways. 
One common definition of innovation is "the use of new ideas, methods and approaches to solve problems." This definition includes many different aspects to innovation, including business models, product design, marketing strategy and even customer service. It's important to note that innovation doesn't have to happen only in the context of business; it can also occur within individual teams or startups. 

The most distinguishing feature of innovation is its impact on society. Innovation can mean different things for different industries, but one thing that's always included is the idea of creating value for others.
