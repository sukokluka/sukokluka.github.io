Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.
