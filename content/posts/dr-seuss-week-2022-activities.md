What are some new ideas to consider?
There are many new ideas to consider when it comes to mental health, such as creating a support system for those with mental illness, expanding access to substances that can help reduce symptoms, and developing treatments specifically tailored to the needs of people withmental illness. Here are some other ideas that may be worth exploring:
1. Create a support system for those with mental illness. There is a wealth of information available online and in books about how to create one, but often people don't have the time or resources to do so. A good way to start is by finding a support group for those with mental illness who are not currently using services. This can be done through online social networks or through local organizations.

2. Expand access to substances that can help reduce symptoms.
