The different types of creativity: How does one become creative?
Creativity is a spectrum that goes from simple to complex. As we move up the spectrum, creativity becomes more abstract and difficult to define. However, all creativity comes from some form of inspiration or imagination. One way to become more creative is by practicing some form of brainstorming or problem-solving.
