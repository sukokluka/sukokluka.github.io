History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.

Creative ideas are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new solutions to problems. There are many different creative ideas out there, so you need to find the ones that fit your needs and interests. Here are some ideas to get started: 
-Create a petition: This is a great way to get people’s attention and show them how you feel about something. You can start by creating a simple Petition on change.org or any other website. Once you have made your case, offer anyone who will listen an argument for why they should change the policy. 

-Dare yourself: If you don’t know what you want or aren’t sure how to get started, take some risks and try something new. Take on an assignment or complete a project that isn’t immediately related to your current lifestyle.

Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.
Without big ideas, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things over and over again. It is big ideas that push us to do better and be better. They challenge us to think differently and see the world in new ways.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.
