The different types of Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is a process of creating a new product or service from scratch. There are many different types of inventions, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Below are three examples of invention:
1) A new type of transportation: A car is an invention, because it has been around for centuries. 
2) A new type of food: We have invented grains and potatoes, so there is no one food that can be called "rice" or "potatoes." 
3) A new way to grow plants: We've invented peas and carrots, so there's no need for planting seeds in the ground all year round.
