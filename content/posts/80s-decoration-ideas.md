Invention 4: a new way to produce energy from renewable resources
Invention ideas can produce energy from renewable resources in a variety of ways, some more efficient than others. One such idea is to create turbines that turn renewable energy into electricity. This could be useful for homes and businesses that do not have access to traditional power sources, or for those who are trying to save money on their energy bill.
