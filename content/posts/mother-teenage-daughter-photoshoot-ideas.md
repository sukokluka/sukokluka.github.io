How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, it’s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what you’re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If it’s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it won’t be successful.

Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.
