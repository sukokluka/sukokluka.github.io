2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.

Ideas are a great source of inspiration and can be used in different ways to improve someone's life. Sometimes, ideas can be used for good, such as creating a new idea for a project, coming up with a new plan to improve upon an old one, or finding a new way to do something. Other times, ideas can be used for bad, such as inventing a new product that no one will ever buy, or coming up with a plan to fail at something.

Invention is the process of creating a new product or technology from scratch. It can be done through creativity, collaboration, and hard work. Some inventions are more famous than others, but no invention is without its challenges. For example, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich was invented by two men – John Montagu and Charles Lindbergh – and it took many years of research and countless attempts to perfect it.
