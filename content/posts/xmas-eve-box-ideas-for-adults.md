How does brainstroming work?
Brainstroming is a form of mental stimulation that allows people to focus and learn. It is commonly used in education, work, and other areas where explosions of information are needed. The process begins by sitting in a quiet room and focusing on one object for 30 seconds. Then, you must take a break for 3 minutes and come back to the object. This process is repeated 10 times. The goal of brainstroming is to create an mental explosion that will allow you to learn more quickly and effectively.

The 4 Cs of Creative Work: What are some factors to consider when coming up with ideas?
Creative work is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. Sometimes, the best way to do this is through brainstorming sessions or informal discussions with friends or colleagues. But what are some factors to consider when coming up with creative ideas? Here are four key ones:
1. Category: What is your idea in question? This will determine its feasibility and whether it can be turned into a successful product or service.
2. Concept: How well does your idea align with the category you have chosen? If it's a new take on an old product, for example, then you'll need to come up with a concept that makes sense within the category being explored. And if your idea isn't aligned in any way, it might not be worth pursuing at all.
3. Target Market: Who can actually use your idea?

What are the big ideas behind your organization?
1. What is your organization's mission? What are its core values? How do you hold yourselves accountable to those values?
2. What makes your organization unique? How do you attract and keep talented individuals and teams?
3. Who decides what is important to your organization? How do you make sure that everyone knows and agrees with the organization's mission and goals?
4. How do you manage conflict within your organization? Who has final say on important decisions, and who can appeal if they feel their opinion is not being heard or respected?
5. Are there any Committee or Board members that are not elected by the membership, but rather appointed by someone outside of the organization (e.g., CEO)? If so, how does this affect the ability for members to voice their opinions effectively within the organization?

Big Ideas are a type of brainstorming tool that can help you come up with new solutions to problems. Big Ideas can be helpful when you have no idea what to do next, or when you need to come up with a plan that will work. Don't be afraid to ask your friends and family for their ideas, either- they may have something that you hadn't considered.
