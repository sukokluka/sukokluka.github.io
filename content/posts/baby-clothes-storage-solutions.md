The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity is an essential part of the artist’s repertoire. The artist must be able to come up with ideas and concepts that are new and original, in order to express themselves through their artwork. Without creativity, artists would not be able to create pieces that convey their messages or share their experiences. Creative art can be seen as a way for the artist to process and reflect on their own emotions and thoughts, while also exploring new boundaries.
