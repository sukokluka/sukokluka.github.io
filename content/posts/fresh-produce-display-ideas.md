What is an invention?
An invention is a new product, process or service that is novel and different from those already in use. Inventions can come from anyone - a small business owner, inventor, scientist or just someone who has an idea for a better way to do something. Some of the most famous inventions include the computer, the telephone and theimplication machine. 
Invention can have many benefits for both the inventor and their customers - often they are the first to bring a product to market that offers a new and exciting solution. The key is to ensure that ideas are properly considered before they are turned into an invention - anything can happen in this process!
