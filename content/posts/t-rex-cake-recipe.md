Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.

The Future of Healthcare: How will we keep our citizens healthy?
As we work to look into the future of healthcare, we must consider many different ideas. One idea that we could consider is having a system where citizens can access health care on-demand. This would mean that patients and doctors would be able to talk with one another directly, and would not have to go through a bureaucracy. Another idea is having healthcare vouchers which could be used to pay for medical services out of pocket. This would help ensure that people are able to get the best care possible while staying healthy. Other ideas include increasing access to mental health services, ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, and creating more affordable healthcare options. All of these ideas are important in order to keep our citizens healthy and safe.
