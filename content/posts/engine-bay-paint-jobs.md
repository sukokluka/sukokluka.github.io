Why certain types of creativity are more successful than others?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or organization. They can be used in a number of ways, both for good and bad. Some creative ideas are more successful than others, and there are some factors that play into this success.
Some creative ideas that have been successful include the design of products, the development of new technologies, and the creating of new concepts.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.
