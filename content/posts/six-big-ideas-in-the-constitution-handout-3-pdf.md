The process of invention: Outline the steps that are involved in creating something new.
1. The process of invention generally starts with an idea. This could be something that you come up with yourself, or something that you see in the world around you.
2. Once you have an idea, the next step is to start working on it. This involves developing the idea further and turning it into a plan or a prototype.

3. The next stage is to test your invention. This could involve making sure it works as intended, or testing it out on a small scale before launching it onto the market.

4. Finally, once you're satisfied with your invention, it's time to commercialize it and bring it to the world. This involves marketing your invention and getting people to use it or buy it.
