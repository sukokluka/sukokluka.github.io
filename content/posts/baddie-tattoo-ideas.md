Origins and Development of Invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, or designing something that has never been done before. Invention can come from anything from ideas to products to even services. The key to any invention is to find a way to make it work and improve on what others have done before. Inventors are always looking for ways to make their inventions more effective, easier to use and less expensive.

Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

2. Add an oven - Ovens are another great addition to the kitchen island equation. They can provide heat and cooking space, as well as offer a sleek look. Be sure to choose one that is properly sized and has an automatic timer so you don't have to keep track of time in the kitchen.
