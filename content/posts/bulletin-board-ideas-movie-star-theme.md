The Psychology of Idea Generation
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that all people have in common. They all want to create something new and exciting, and they all feel like they can do it. This is where creativity comes into play. People are able to come up with ideas on their own, but often they need help coming up with the best ones. Here are four ways to get creative juices flowing:
1. Take on a smaller project: Sometimes the best way to get started with an idea is by taking on a smaller project that you can complete quickly and easily. This will help you get your head around the concept and start thinking about ways that you could improve it.

2. Draw on your experience: When you have some experience under your belt, it becomes easier to come up with powerful ideas.
