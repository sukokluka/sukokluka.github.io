How to brainstorm effectively
It is important to know how to brainstorm effectively in order to get the most out of your ideas. Here are a few tips on how to do just that:
1. Relax and let your mind wander. The best ideas usually come when you’re not trying too hard to think of them. So take a break, go for a walk, or do something else that will help you relax.

2. Set some ground rules. Once you have a general idea of what you want to brainstorm about, it can be helpful to set some parameters for yourself. This will help keep your thoughts focused and prevent you from getting too sidetracked.

3. Write down everything that comes to mind. No matter how silly or irrelevant it may seem, write it down anyway.

The history of invention: From ancient times to the modern day
Invention is the act of creating a new object or idea from scratch. It has been around for centuries, and some of the most iconic inventions include the wheel, the telephone, and insulin. However, there are also some less well-known inventions that have had a significant impact on our lives. For example, the condom was invented by a man named John Hargrave in 1877. He came up with the idea after seeing a group of men fighting outside his home. He realized that if he could create a device that prevented conception then he could prevent any future fights between men and prevent them from ending in bloodshed.
