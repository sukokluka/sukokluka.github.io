Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.

Ideas are a powerful tool for selling and developing products. If you can come up with good ones, your pitch will be more successful. Here are some tips for creating an idea pitch that will be successful:
1. Start by identifying what your product or service does that others don't. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the problem someone else is trying to solve.
2. Find a analogy or metaphor that resonates with your target audience and helps explain how your product or service would solve that problem.
3. Be clear and concise when describing what your product or service does and how it would benefit customers. Your target audience will appreciate clarity in their purchase decision-making process.
4. Demonstrate why people should buy your product or service instead of those of your competitors.
