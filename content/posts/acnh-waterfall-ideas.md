Ideas for Bigger Ideas: What are some ideas for bigger ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are plenty of them out there. And while all of them have potential to make a real impact, some may be more achievable than others. Here are some ideas for bigger ideas:
1. Make the world a better place through innovation. This is something that has been talked about for years and it's still not happening as fast as people need it to. Innovation can come from anything – from improving education to developing new ways of manufacturing products.

2. Create more jobs in the United States. The country is struggling right now and there are too many people without good jobs.

Some examples include creating new businesses or increasing the number of job opportunities at existing businesses.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.

Creativity and risk: What are some dangers of being creative?
Creativity is a good thing, right? After all, creativity is what allows people to come up with new ways to do things. But being creative can also have dangerous consequences. Here are some dangers of being creative:
1) You might not be able to think of anything new. This is especially true if you're someone who's constantly brainstorming and coming up with new ideas. It can be tough when you don't have any fresh ideas in your head, and that can lead to problems.

2) You might not be aware of the risks involved in your work. If you're working on something that you believe in and care about, it's important to be mindful of the risks involved in its creation. But if you're not sure about the risks, then you might not tell anyone about them – which could lead to them getting hurt or worse.
