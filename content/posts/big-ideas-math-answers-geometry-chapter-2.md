Benefits and Risks of Invention: What are the benefits and risks of an innovation?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea, product or service. There are many benefits to invention, ranging from creating new products and services to saving lives and improving the quality of life. However, there are also risks associated with innovation, including the risk of losing valuable technology or intellectual property. Here are four key Benefits of Invention: 
1) Innovation can create new opportunities for businesses and individuals. When a company comes up with a new product or service, it can now sell those ideas and products to other companies and consumers around the world. This creates economic opportunity for businesses and allows people to have more choices in what they eat, drink and wear. 

2) Innovation can help improve the quality of life for people around the world. Inventions can save lives by making it easier for people to get medical treatment or cure diseases.

The definition of art: Who makes it and what does it represent?
Creative art is a term that has been bandied about for a long time, with no one really having a clear definition of what it actually means. In many cases, it seems to be subjective and up to the artist themselves what constitutes as creative art. However, in spite of its nebulous nature, there are some key factors that seem to be essential to the definition of creative art. These include the artists' own personal vision and feelings towards their work, as well as the medium or technique used. Whether it's painting or sculpture, music or photography - any form of creative art can be said to have its own unique meaning and personality.
