The process: How do you go about brainstorming ideas?
brainstorming ideas can be a fun and quick way to come up with new ideas, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind in order to create the best brainstorming experience. First, make sure that you have some idea of what you want your brainstorming session to be about. If you don't know what you want your meeting to become, it's probably not going to be as productive. Additionally, it's important that everyone is on the same page when it comes time for the brainstorming process. If one person starts talking and then somebody else joins in, it's difficult to continue getting productive ideas out of the group. Finally, make sure that everyone has their own space in which they can work without feeling crowded or interrupted.
