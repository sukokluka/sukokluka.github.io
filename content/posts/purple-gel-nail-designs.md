The 5 Big Ideas of Creativity
Creativity is an important concept in our lives. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to find solutions to problems. Here are five big ideas of creativity: 1. One can be creative when they are thinking out loud – this means that they are not just focusing on one thing. They are brainstorming and working on multiple ideas simultaneously. This is an excellent way to get inspired and come up with new ideas. 2. One can be creative when they are working alone – this means that they have complete freedom and control over their work space. They can work on whatever they want, and no one else is interfering or checking them out. This can be a great way to come up with unique and innovative ideas. 3. One can be creative when they are working with others – this means that they are collaborating with other people throughout the entire process of creating something.
