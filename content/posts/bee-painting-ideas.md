4) Transform transportation infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure is important for both people and businesses. It includes roads, bridges, airports, and other areas that allow people to move around and businesses to run their operations. But as the world moves increasingly towards electric vehicles and other forms of transportation that don't use gasoline or oil, the need for transportation infrastructure will only become more important. 
One way to improve the transportation infrastructure is to create more efficient ways to generate energy. Another way to improve it is to consider how people can be better connected with one another while they are on their way to or from work or school. 

There are a number of ideas that could be put into place in order to improve transportation infrastructure.

Creative ideas: What are some good ways to come up with new ideas?
Creative ideas can come in many forms, but the most common way to come up with new ideas is through brainstorming. This is a process where you take whatever you think of and turn it into a plan. Once you have a plan, it's time to start thinking about how to put your ideas into practice. Here are some helpful tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1) Start with small concepts. When you have a lot of Ideas, it can be difficult to filter them all down into something that will work well. Smaller concepts are easier to think about and can be implemented quickly.

2) Take things one step at a time. When you're brainstorming, it's important to try and keep everything in mind at the same time so that you don't get overwhelmed. Instead, focus on one or two main ideas and go from there.
