Here are a few examples:\nYou might not be able to come up with big ideas because you’re not inspired by other people or things. You might not be able to come up with ideas that are unique or interesting because nobody has ever done them before. You might not be able to come up with great ideas because you’re too timid or scared to try something new. You might not be able to come up with great ideas because your mind is too concentrated on detail instead of taking a broader view.
